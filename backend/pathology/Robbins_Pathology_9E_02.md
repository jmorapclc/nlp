Common Features of Invasive Cancers
In all forms of breast cancer, local disease progression leads to similar physical findings. Invasive cancers tend to become adherent and fixed to the pectoral muscles or deep fascia of the chest wall and the overlying skin, with consequent retrac -
tion or dimpling of the skin or nipple. The latter is an impor -
tant sign because it may be the first indication of malignancy. Involvement of the lymphatic pathways may result in local -
ized lymphedema.

In such cases, the skin becomes thickened around exaggerated hair follicles, giving an appearance known as peau d’orange (“orange peel”). B A

within large pools of mucin.

Note the characteristic well-circumscribed border, which mimics the appearance of benign masses. Clinical Course
Breast cancer often is discovered by the patient or her phy -
sician as a deceptively discrete, solitary, painless, and movable mass. At the time of clinical detection, the carci -
noma typically is 2 to 3 cm in size, and involvement of 
the regional lymph nodes (most often axillary) is already present in about 50% of patients.

With mammographic screening, carcinomas frequently are detected even before they become palpable. The average invasive carcinoma 
found by mammographic screening is around 1 cm in size, 
and only 15% of these have produced nodal metastases. In addition, DCIS often is detected before the development 
of invasive carcinoma during screening.

As women age, fibrous breast tissue is replaced by fat, and screening becomes more sensitive as a result of the increased radio -
lucency of the breast and the increased incidence of malig -
nancy. The current controversy over the best time to begin mammographic screening arises from efforts to balance the benefits of early cancer detection in some women with the

risks of radiation exposure and the morbidity and expense 
associated with clinical workup of benign breast lesions 
(false positives). Magnetic resonance imaging is being studied as an adjunct to mammographic screening in high-risk, young patients with dense breasts that are difficult to image by mammography. Breast cancer spread occurs through lymphatic and 
hematogenous channels. Outer quadrant and centrally located lesions typically spread first to the axillary nodes.

Those in the medial inner quadrants often travel first to lymph nodes along the internal mammary arteries. More distant dissemination eventually ensues, and can involve virtually any organ or tissue in the body. Favored locations are the lungs, skeleton, liver, adrenals, and (less commonly) brain, but no site is exempt. Metastases may come to clinical 
attention many years after apparent therapeutic control of the primary lesion, sometimes as long as 15 years later.

Neverthe-
less, with each passing year without disease recurrence, the likelihood of cure increases. Prognosis of breast cancers is influenced by the follow -
ing variables the first three of which are components of the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging classification:
- Tumor invasion and size. In situ carcinomas carry an excellent prognosis (5-year survival rate greater than 
90%), as do invasive carcinomas less than 2 cm in size 
(5-year survival rate of 87%).

- Extent of lymph node involvement. With no axillary node involvement, the 5-year survival rate is close to 80%. Survival is inversely related to the number of involved lymph nodes and is less than 50% with 16 or more involved nodes. Sentinel node biopsy is currently the mainstay for staging the axilla. This procedure identifies the primary lymph node(s) that drain the breast paren -
chyma using dye or a radioactive tracer (or sometimes both).

Once identified, sentinel nodes are removed and examined microscopically. A sentinel lymph node that is free from carcinoma (a “negative node”) is highly predictive of absence of metastatic carcinoma in the remaining lymph nodes. A “positive node,” on the other hand, is an indication for a complete axillary dissection, which is used to stage the patient’s disease. - Distant metastases.

Patients who develop hematogenous spread are rarely curable, although chemotherapy may prolong survival (the 5-year survival rate is approxi -
mately 15%). - Histologic grade. The most common grading system for breast cancer evaluates tubule formation, nuclear grade, and mitotic rate. Well-differentiated carcinomas are associated with a significantly better prognosis than poorly differentiated carcinomas.

Moderately differenti-ated carcinomas initially have a good prognosis, but survival at 20 years approaches that for poorly differen -
tiated carcinomas. - The histologic type of carcinoma. All specialized types of 
breast carcinoma (tubular, medullary, and mucinous) are associated with a somewhat better prognosis than carcinomas of no special type ( ductal carcinomas). A 
major exception is inflammatory carcinoma, which has a poor prognosis.

- The presence or absence of estrogen or progesterone receptors. The presence of hormone receptors confers a slightly better prognosis. However, the practical reason for determining their presence is to predict the response to therapy. The highest rate of response (approximately 80%) to antiestrogen therapy (oophorectomy or tamoxi -
fen) is seen in women whose tumor cells express both estrogen and progesterone receptors.

Lower rates of response (25% to 45%) are seen if only estrogen receptor is present. If both are absent, very few patients (less than 10%) respond. - Overexpression of HER2/NEU. Overexpression of this membrane-bound protein is almost always caused by gene amplification and can be determined by immuno -
histochemistry (which assesses protein levels) or by fluorescence in situ hybridization (which assesses the gene copy number). Overexpression is associated with a poorer prognosis.

However, the clinical importance of evaluating HER2/NEU lies in predicting response to trastuzumab (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits the function of HER2/NEU. This remains one of the best-characterized examples of an effective therapy directed against a tumor-specific molecular lesion. Why some cancers recur after postoperative therapy 
while others do not remains a mystery.

As mentioned earlier, gene expression profiling of breast cancers on microarrays (gene chips) (Chapter 5) has defined several molecular classes of breast cancer and also has been 
used to develop commercial tests that may predict the response of an individual patient’s tumor to chemother -
apy. At present there is insufficient data on the prognostic value of such tests. SUMMARY

The rudimentary male breast is relatively free of pathologic 
involvement. Only two disorders occur with sufficient fre -
quency to be considered here: gynecomastia and carcinoma. Gynecomastia
As in females, male breasts are subject to hormonal influ -
ences, but they are considerably less sensitive in this regard than female breasts.

Nonetheless, enlargement of the male breast, or gynecomastia, may occur in response to absolute or relative estrogen excesses. The most important cause of hyperestrinism in the male is cirrhosis and the consequent inability of the liver to metabolize estrogens. Other causes include Klinefelter syndrome, anabolic steroids, and some pharmacologic agents. Physiologic gynecomastia often occurs in puberty and in extreme old age.

The morphologic features of gynecomastia include an 
increase in connective tissue and epithelial hyperplasia of the ducts; lobule formation is rare. Clinically, a button-like, subareolar swelling develops, usually in both breasts but occasionally in only one. Carcinoma
Breast cancer is rare in men, with an incidence less than 1% of that reported for women. It typically is diagnosed in advanced age.

The endocrine system is a highly integrated and widely 
distributed group of organs that orchestrate a state of meta -
bolic equilibrium, or homeostasis, among the various tissues of the body.

Signaling by extracellular secreted mol -
ecules can be classified as one of three types—autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine—according to the distance over which the signal acts (Chapter 2). In endocrine signaling, the 
secreted molecules, which frequently are called hormones, 
act on target cells distant from their site of synthesis. An endocrine hormone typically is carried by the blood from its site of release to its target.

Increased activity of the target tissue often downregulates the activity of the gland that secretes the stimulating hormone, a process known as feed-
back inhibition.

Hormones can be classified into several broad catego -
ries, based on the nature of their receptors:
- Hormones that trigger biochemical signals upon interacting with cell surface receptors: This large class of compounds is composed of two groups: (1) peptide hormones, 
such as growth hormone and insulin, and (2) small mole -
cules, such as epinephrine.

Binding of these hormones 
to cell surface receptors leads to an increase in intracel -
lular molecules, termed second messengers, such as 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c AMP); production of mediators from membrane phospholipids (e.g., inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate); and shifts in intracellular levels of ionized calcium.

Elevated levels of one or more of these compounds can change proliferation, differentiation, survival, and functional activity of cells, mainly by regu-lating the expression of specific genes. - Hormones that diffuse across the plasma membrane and inter -
act with intracellular receptors : Many lipid-soluble hor -
mones pass through the plasma membrane by diffusion to interact with receptors in the cytosol or the nucleus.

The resulting hormone-receptor complexes bind specifi-cally to promoter and enhancer elements in DNA, Endocrine System See T argeted Therapy available online at

Figure  19–1 Normal architecture of the anterior pituitary. The gland 
is populated by several distinct cell types containing a variety of stimulat -
ing (trophic) hormones. Each of the hormones has different staining 
characteristics, resulting in a mixture of cell types in routine histologic preparations. Note also the presence of a fine reticulin network. thereby affecting the expression of specific target genes.

Hormones of this type include the steroids (e.g., estrogen, 
progesterone, glucocorticoids), the retinoids (vitamin A), 
and thyroxine. Several processes may disturb the normal activity of the endocrine system, including impaired synthesis or release of hormones, abnormal interactions between hormones and their target tissues, and abnormal responses of target organs to their hormones.

Endocrine diseases can be 
generally classified as (1) diseases of underproduction or overproduction of hormones, with associated biochemical and clinical consequences, or (2) diseases associated with the development of mass lesions, which may be nonfunc -
tional or may be associated with overproduction or under -
production of hormones.

With the exception of mass lesions, study of endocrine 
diseases relies heavily on biochemical measurements of 
the levels of hormones, their regulators, and other metabolites. PITUITARY
The pituitary gland is a small, bean-shaped structure that lies at the base of the brain within the confines of the sella turcica.

It is intimately related to the hypothalamus, with which it is connected by both a stalk, composed of axons 
extending from the hypothalamus, and a rich venous plexus constituting a portal circulation. Along with the hypothalamus, the pituitary has a central role in the regula -
tion of most of the other endocrine glands. The pituitary is composed of two morphologically and functionally dis -
tinct components: the anterior lobe (adenohypophysis) and the posterior lobe (neurohypophysis).

Diseases of the pitu -
itary, accordingly, can be divided into those that primarily affect the anterior lobe and those that primarily affect the posterior lobe. The anterior pituitary, or adenohypophysis, is composed of 
epithelial cells derived embryologically from the develop -
ing oral cavity. In routine histologic sections, a colorful array of cells containing basophilic cytoplasm, eosinophilic cytoplasm, or poorly staining ( chromophobic) cytoplasm is 
present (Fig. 19–1
).

Detailed studies using electron micros -
copy and immunocytochemical techniques have demon -
strated that the staining properties of these cells are related to the presence of various trophic polypeptide hormones within their cytoplasm.

The release of trophic hormones is in turn under the control of factors produced in the hypo -
thalamus; while most hypothalamic factors are stimulatory and promote pituitary hormone release, others (e.g., soma -
tostatin and dopamine) are inhibitory in their effects ( Fig. 19–2). Rarely, signs and symptoms of pituitary disease may be caused by excess or lack of the hypothalamic factors, rather than by a primary pituitary abnormality.

Symptoms and signs of pituitary disease can be grouped 
as follows:
- Hyperpituitarism-related effects: Hyperpituitarism arises from excessive secretion of trophic hormones. It most often results from an anterior pituitary adenoma but also 
may be caused by other pituitary and extrapituitary lesions, as described subsequently. The symptoms and signs of hyperpituitarism are discussed in the context of individual tumors, later in the chapter.

- Hypopituitarism-related effects: Hypopituitarism is caused by deficiency of trophic hormones and results from a variety of destructive processes, including isch-
emic injury, surgery or radiation, and inflammatory reac-
tions. In addition, nonfunctional pituitary adenomas may 
encroach upon and destroy adjacent normal anterior pituitary parenchyma, causing hypopituitarism.

- Local mass effects : Among the earliest changes referable 
to mass effect are radiographic abnormalities of the sella 
turcica, including sellar expansion, bony erosion, and disruption of the diaphragma sellae. Because of the close proximity of the optic nerves and chiasm to the sella, expanding pituitary lesions often compress decussating fibers in the optic chiasm.

This altered neuroanatomy gives rise to visual field abnormalities, classically in the 
form of defects in the lateral (temporal) visual fields—a so-called bitemporal hemianopsia. As in the case of any 
expanding intracranial mass, pituitary adenomas may produce signs and symptoms of elevated intracranial pres -
sure, including headache, nausea, and vomiting.

Pitu -
itary adenomas that extend beyond the sella turcica into the base of the brain (invasive pituitary adenoma) produce seizures or obstructive hydrocephalus; involve-
ment of cranial nerves can result in cranial nerve palsy. On occasion, acute hemorrhage into an adenoma is asso -
ciated with clinical evidence of rapid enlargement of the lesion and depression of consciousness, a situation appropriately termed pituitary apoplexy.

Acute pituitary 
apoplexy constitutes a neurosurgical emergency, because it may be rapidly fatal.

717 Hyperpituitarism and Pituitary Adenomas 
composed of a single cell type and produce a single 
predominant hormone, but there are some exceptions. Some pituitary adenomas can secrete two different hor -
mones (growth hormone and prolactin being the most common combination); rarely, pituitary adenomas are plurihormonal.

At the other end of the spectrum, pitu -
itary adenomas also may be truly “ hormone negative,” as 
indicated by absence of immunohistochemical reactivity or ultrastructural evidence of hormone production. - Most pituitary adenomas occur as sporadic (i.e., non-
familial) lesions. In about 5% of cases, however, adeno -
mas occur as a result of an inherited predisposition (see later).

- Pituitary adenomas are designated, somewhat arbi -
trarily, as microadenomas if they are less than 1 cm in 
diameter and macroadenomas if they exceed 1 cm in 
diameter. - Nonfunctioning and hormone-negative adenomas are 
likely to come to clinical attention at a later stage and are, therefore, more likely to be macroadenomas than HYPERPITUITARISM AND 
PITUITARY ADENOMAS
The most common cause of hyperpituitarism is an adenoma arising in the anterior lobe.

Other, less common, causes include hyperplasia and carcinomas of the anterior pitu -
itary, secretion of hormones by some extrapituitary tumors, and certain hypothalamic disorders. Some salient features of pituitary adenomas are as follows:
- Pituitary adenomas are classified on the basis of hormone(s) produced by the neoplastic cells, which are detected by immu -
nohistochemical stains performed on tissue sections (Table 
19–1).

- Pituitary adenomas can be functional (i.e., associated 
with hormone excess and clinical manifestations thereof) or nonfunctioning (i.e., demonstration of hormone 
production at the tissue level only, without clinical 
mani festations of hormone excess).

Both functional 
and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas usually are Figure  19–2 The adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary) releases six hormones: adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or corticotropin; follicle-
stimulating hormone (FSH); growth hormone (GH), or somatotropin; luteinizing hormone (LH); prolactin (PRL); and thyroid-stimulating hormone 
(TSH), or thyrotropin. These hormones are in turn under the control of various stimulatory and inhibitory hypothalamic releasing factors.

The stimula-
tory releasing factors are corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn RH), and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). The inhibitory
 hypothalamic factors are growth hormone inhibitory hormone (GIH), or somato -
statin, and prolactin inhibitory factor (PIF), which is the same as dopamine.

PATHOGENESIS
With recent advances in molecular techniques, substantial 
insight has been gained into the genetic  abnormalities  
associated  with pituitary  adenomas:
- Guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein) mutations 
are the best-characterized molecular abnormalities in these neoplasms.

G proteins have a critical role in signal transduction, transmitting signals from 
cell surface  
receptors (e.g., growth hormone–releasing hormone receptor) to 
intracellular  effectors (e.g., adenyl 
cyclase), which then generate second  messengers (e.g., 
c AMP). G s is a stimulatory G protein that has a pivotal role 
in signal transduction in several endocrine organs, includ -
ing the pituitary.

G s exists as an inactive protein, with 
guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound to the guanine nucleotide–binding site of the alpha subunit of G
s, encoded 
by the GNAS1 gene. On triggering of the hormone recep-
tor, GDP dissociates, and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binds to G
sα, activating the G protein. GTP-bound G sα 
directly interacts with and activates its effectors (such as adenyl cyclase), with a resultant increase in intracellular c AMP .

The c AMP acts as a potent mitogenic stimulus for a variety of endocrine cell types, promoting cellular pro-liferation and hormone synthesis and secretion. The acti -
vation of G
sα and the resultant generation of c AMP are 
transient because of an intrinsic GTPase activity in the α-subunit, which hydrolyzes GTP into GDP .

A mutation  
in the α-subunit  that interferes  with its intrinsic  
GTPase  activity  therefore  results  in constitutive  
activation  of Gsα, persistent  generation  of c AMP ,  
and unchecked  cellular  proliferation. Approximately 
40% of growth hormone–secreting somatotroph cell adenomas and a minority of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)–secreting corticotroph cell adenomas bear GNAS1 mutations.

- As stated previously, approximately 5% of pituitary adeno -
mas arise as a consequence of an inherited predisposition. Four  genes  have been  identified  thus far as a 
cause  of familial  pituitary  adenomas:  MEN1, 
CDKN1B, PRKAR1A,  and AIP. Germline inactivating 
mutations of the MEN1 gene are responsible for multiple 
endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1 (MEN-1) (discussed in detail later on).

The product of the CDKN1B gene is the 
cell cycle checkpoint regulator p27 or KIP1; germline mutations of CDKN1B are responsible for a subset of 
patients with a “MEN-1 like” syndrome who lack MEN1 
abnor malities.

The gene encoding the aryl hydrocarbon  
receptor–interacting  protein (AIP) is a recently 
described pituitary adenoma predisposition gene, and patients with AIP germline mutations often develop 
GH-secreting adenomas at a younger age (before 35 years) than that typical for sporadic GH adenoma patients. - Mutations of TP53 in pituitary adenomas are associated 
with a propensity for aggressive behavior, such as invasion and recurrence.

MORPHOLOGY
The usual pituitary adenoma is a well-circumscribed, soft lesion that may, in the case of smaller tumors, be confined by the sella turcica. Larger lesions may compress the optic chiasm and adjacent structures ( Fig. 19–3), erode the sella 
turcica and anterior clinoid processes, and extend locally 
into the cavernous and sphenoidal sinuses. In as many as 
30% of cases, the adenomas are nonencapsulated and infil -
trate adjacent bone, dura, and (uncommonly) brain.

Foci 
of hemorrhage and/or necrosis are common in larger adenomas. Pituitary adenomas are composed of relatively uniform, 
polygonal cells arrayed in sheets, cords, or papillae. Support -
ing connective tissue, or reticulin, is sparse, accounting for the soft, gelatinous consistency of many of these tumors. The nuclei of the neoplastic cells may be uniform or pleo -
morphic. Mitotic activity usually is scanty.

The cytoplasm 
of the constituent cells may be acidophilic, basophilic, or chromophobic, depending on the type and amount of 
secretory product within the cell, but it is fairly uniform throughout the neoplasm. This cellular  monomorphism  
and the absence  of a significant  reticulin  network  
distinguish  pituitary  adenomas  from  non-neoplastic  
anterior  pituitary  parenchyma (Fig. 19–4). The func -
tional status of the adenoma cannot be reliably predicted from its histologic appearance.

Adenomas that harbor 
TP53 mutations often demonstrate brisk mitotic activity and higher proliferation rates and are designated 
atypical  
adenomas to reinforce their potential for aggressive behavior. Figure  19–3 Pituitary adenoma. This massive, nonfunctioning adenoma 
has grown far beyond the confines of the sella turcica and has distorted 
the overlying brain. Nonfunctioning adenomas tend to be larger at the time of diagnosis than those that secrete a hormone.

are lesions associated with endocrine abnormalities. In 
addition, nonfunctioning adenomas may cause hypopi-

may be caused by conditions or factors other than 
prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas, including preg -
nancy, high-dose estrogen therapy, renal failure, hypothy -
roidism, hypothalamic lesions, and dopamine-inhibiting 
drugs (e.g., reserpine).

In addition, any mass in the supra -
sellar compartment may disturb the normal inhibitory influence of hypothalamus on prolactin secretion, resulting in hyperprolactinemia—a mechanism known as the stalk 
effect. Thus, mild elevations of serum prolactin (less than 
200 µg/L) in a patient with a pituitary adenoma do not 
necessarily indicate a prolactin-secreting neoplasm.

Growth Hormone–Producing (Somatotroph Cell) 
Adenomas
Growth hormone–producing neoplasms (somatotroph cell 
adenomas), including those that produce a mixture of growth hormone and other hormones (e.g., prolactin), 
constitute the second most common type of functional pituitary adenoma. Because the clinical manifestations of excessive growth hormone may be subtle, somatotroph cell adenomas may be quite large by the time they come to clinical attention.

On microscopic examination, growth hormone–producing adenomas are composed of densely or sparsely granulated cells, and immunohistochemical staining demonstrates growth hormone within the cyto-
plasm of the neoplastic cells. Small amounts of immuno -
reactive prolactin often are present as well. Persistent hypersecretion of growth hormone stimulates the 
hepatic secretion of insulin-like growth factor I (somatomedin C), which causes many of the clinical manifestations.

If a growth 
hormone–secreting adenoma occurs before the epiphyses close, as is the case in prepubertal children, excessive levels of growth hormone result in gigantism. This condition is 
characterized by a generalized increase in body size, with disproportionately long arms and legs.

If elevated levels of growth hormone persist, or develop after closure of the epiphyses, affected persons develop acromegaly, in which 
growth is most conspicuous in soft tissues, skin, and viscera and in the bones of the face, hands, and feet. Enlargement of the jaw results in its protrusion (prognathism), with broadening of the lower face and separation of the teeth. The hands and feet are enlarged, with broad, sausage-like fingers.

In clinical practice, the gigantism typically is accompanied by evidence of acromegaly. Growth hormone excess also is associated with a number 
of other disturbances, including abnormal glucose toler -
ance and diabetes mellitus, generalized muscle weakness, hypertension, arthritis, osteoporosis, and congestive heart failure.

Prolactin is demonstrable in a number of growth hormone–producing adenomas and in some cases may be released in sufficient quantities to produce signs and symp -
toms of hyperprolactinemia. Adrenocorticotropic Hormone–Producing 
(Corticotroph Cell) Adenomas
Most corticotroph cell adenomas are small (microadeno -
mas) at the time of diagnosis.

These adenomas stain posi -
tively with periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stains, as a result of Prolactinomas
Prolactinomas are the most common type of hyperfunctioning 
pituitary adenoma. They range in size from small microad -
enomas to large, expansile tumors associated with consid -
erable mass effect. Prolactin is demonstrable within the cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells by immunohistochemical techniques. Hyperprolactinemia causes amenorrhea, galactorrhea, 
loss of libido, and infertility.

Because many of the mani -
festations of hyperprolactinemia (e.g., amenorrhea) are 
more obvious in premenopausal women than in men or postmenopausal women, prolactinomas usually are diag-nosed at an earlier stage in women of reproductive age than in other persons so affected. By contrast, hormonal manifestations may be quite subtle in men and older women, in whom the tumor may reach considerable size before coming to clinical attention. Hyperprolactinemia

Hyperpituitarism
- The most common cause of hyperpituitarism is an ante ­
rior lobe pituitary adenoma. - Pituitary adenomas can be macroadenomas (greater than 
1 cm in diameter) or microadenomas (less than 1 cm 
across), and on clinical evaluation, they can be functional or nonfunctioning.

- Macroadenomas may potentially lead to mass effects, 
including visual disturbances. - Functioning adenomas ar e associated with distinct 
endocrine signs and symptoms. - Mutation of the GNAS1 gene, which results in constitutive 
activation of a stimulatory G protein, is one of the more common genetic alterations. - The two distinctive morphologic features of most adeno ­
mas are their cellular monomorphism and absence of a reticulin network.

SUMMARY
Clinical Manifestations of Pituitary Adenomas
- Prolactinomas: amenorrhea, galactorrhea, loss of libido, and 
infertility
- Growth hormone (somatotroph cell) adenomas: gigantism (children), acromegaly (adults), and impaired glucose 
tolerance and diabetes mellitus
- Corticotroph cell adenomas : Cushing syndrome, hyper­
pigmentation
- All pituitary adenomas, particularly nonfunctioning ade ­
nomas, may be associated with mass effects and hypo­pituitarism.

the accumulation of glycosylated ACTH protein. As in the case of other pituitary hormones, the secretory granules can be detected by immunohistochemical methods. By electron microscopy they appear as membrane-bound, electron-dense granules averaging 300 nm in diameter. Corticotroph cell adenomas may be clinically silent or 
may cause hypercortisolism, manifested clinically as Cushing 
syndrome, because of the stimulatory effect of ACTH on the adrenal cortex.

Cushing syndrome, discussed in more detail later with diseases of the adrenal gland, may be caused by a wide variety of conditions in addition to ACTH-producing pituitary neoplasms. When the hyper -
cortisolism is caused by excessive production of ACTH by the pituitary, the process is designated Cushing disease, 
because it is the pattern of hypercortisolism originally described by Dr. Harvey Cushing.

Large, clinically aggres -
sive corticotroph cell adenomas may develop after surgical removal of the adrenal glands for treatment of Cushing syndrome. In most instances, this condition, known as Nelson syndrome, results from loss of the inhibitory effect of adrenal corticosteroids on a preexisting corticotroph micro -
adenoma. Because the adrenals are absent in persons with Nelson syndrome, hypercortisolism does not develop. Instead, patients present with the mass effects of the pitu -
itary tumor.

In addition, because ACTH is synthesized 
as part of a larger prohormone substance that includes melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), hyperpigmenta-tion also may be a feature. Other Anterior Pituitary Neoplasms
- Gonadotroph (luteinizing hormone [LH]–producing and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]–producing) adenomas can be difficult to recognize, because they secrete hor -
mones inefficiently and variably, and the secretory products usually do not cause a recognizable clinical syndrome.

They are typically detected when the tumors have become large enough to cause neurologic signs and symptoms, such as impaired vision, headaches, diplo -
pia, or pituitary apoplexy. The neoplastic cells usually demonstrate immunoreactivity for the common gonado -
tropin α-subunit and the specific β-FSH and β-LH sub-
units; FSH usually is the predominant secreted hormone.

- Thyrotroph (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]–producing) adenomas account for about 1% of all pituitary adenomas and constitute a rare cause of hyperthyroidism. - Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas comprise both clini -
cally silent counterparts of the functioning adenomas just described (for example, a silent gonadotroph adenoma) 
and true hormone-negative (null cell) adenomas; the latter 
are quite infrequent, and as noted, many have been reclassified using improved diagnostic techniques.

Non -
functioning adenomas constitute approximately 25% 
of all pituitary tumors. Not surprisingly, the typical 
presentation with nonfunctioning adenomas is one 
characterized by mass effects. These lesions also may compromise the residual anterior pituitary sufficiently to produce hypopituitarism. - Pituitary carcinomas are exceedingly rare. In addition to local extension beyond the sella turcica, these tumors virtually always demonstrate distant metastases.

HYPOPITUITARISM
Hypofunction of the anterior pituitary may occur with loss or absence of 75% or more of the anterior pituitary paren -
chyma. This may be congenital (exceedingly rare) or may 
result from a wide range of acquired abnormalities that are 
intrinsic to the pituitary. Less frequently, disorders that interfere with the delivery of pituitary hormone–releasing factors from the hypothalamus, such as hypothalamic tumors, also may cause hypofunction of the anterior pitu -
itary.

Hypopituitarism accompanied by evidence of posterior 
pituitary dysfunction in the form of diabetes insipidus (see later) 
is almost always of hypothalamic origin. Most cases of anterior 
pituitary hypofunction are caused by
- Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (discussed earlier)
- Ischemic necrosis of the anterior pituitary, an important 
cause of pituitary insufficiency.

The anterior pituitary has substantial reserve capacity; as a result, destruction of large amounts of the anterior pituitary (75% or greater) must occur before signs and symptoms of hypopituita -
rism develop. Sheehan syndrome, or postpartum necrosis 
of the anterior pituitary, is the most common form of clinically significant ischemic necrosis of the anterior pituitary.

During pregnancy, the anterior pituitary enlarges considerably, largely because of an increase in the size and number of prolactin-secreting cells. This physiologic enlargement of the gland, however, is not accompanied by an increase in blood supply from the low-pressure portal venous system. The enlarged gland is thus vulnerable to ischemic injury, especially in women who experience significant hemorrhage and hypotension during the peripartal period.

The posterior pituitary, because it receives its blood directly from arte -
rial branches, is much less susceptible to ischemic injury and therefore usually is not affected. Clinically signifi-cant pituitary necrosis also may be encountered in other conditions, including disseminated intravascular coagu -
lation, sickle cell anemia, elevated intracranial pressure, traumatic injury, and shock of any origin. The residual gland is shrunken and scarred.

- Ablation of the pituitary by surgery or irradiation
- Other, less common causes of anterior pituitary hypo -
function, including inflammatory lesions such as

different stimuli, including increased plasma oncotic pres -
sure, left atrial distention, exercise, and certain emotional 
states, ADH is released from axon terminals in the neuro -
hypophysis into the general circulation. The hormone acts on the collecting tubules of the kidney to promote the resorption of free water.

ADH deficiency causes diabetes 
insipidus, a condition characterized by excessive urination (polyuria) caused by an inability of the kidney to properly resorb water from the urine. Diabetes insipidus can result from several causes, including head trauma, neoplasms, and inflammatory disorders of the hypothalamus and 
pituitary, and from surgical procedures involving the hypothalamus or pituitary.

The condition sometimes 
arises spontaneously ( idiopathic) in the absence of an under -
lying disorder. Diabetes insipidus from ADH deficiency is designated as central, to differentiate it from nephrogenic 
diabetes insipidus as a result of renal tubular unrespon -
siveness to circulating ADH. The clinical manifestations of both diseases are similar and include the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine with an inappropriately low spe -
cific gravity.

Serum sodium and osmolality are increased as a result of excessive renal loss of free water, resulting 
in thirst and polydipsia. Patients who can drink water 
generally can compensate for urinary losses; patients who are obtunded, bedridden, or otherwise limited in their ability to obtain water may develop life-threatening dehydration. In the syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH) secretion, 
ADH excess is caused by several extracranial and intracra -
nial disorders.

This condition leads to resorption of exces -
sive amounts of free water, with resultant hyponatremia. The most common causes of SIADH include the secretion of ectopic ADH by malignant neoplasms (particularly small cell carcinomas of the lung), non-neoplastic diseases of the lung, and local injury to the hypothalamus or neu -
rohypophysis. The clinical manifestations of SIADH are dominated by hyponatremia, cerebral edema, and resul-tant neurologic dysfunction.

Although total body water is increased, blood volume remains normal, and peripheral edema does not develop.sarcoidosis or tuberculosis, trauma, and metastatic neo -
plasms involving the pituitary. The clinical manifestations of anterior pituitary hypofunc -
tion depend on the specific hormones that are lacking. In children, growth failure ( pituitary dwarfism) may occur as 
a result of growth hormone deficiency.

Gonadotropin or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn RH) deficiency leads to amenorrhea and infertility in women and to decreased libido, impotence, and loss of pubic and axillary hair in men. TSH and ACTH deficiencies result in symptoms of hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism, respectively, and are discussed later in the chapter. Prolactin deficiency results in failure of postpartum lactation.

The anterior pitu -
itary also is a rich source of MSH, synthesized from the same precursor molecule that produces ACTH; therefore, one of the manifestations of hypopituitarism is pallor from loss of stimulatory effects of MSH on melanocytes. POSTERIOR PITUITARY SYNDROMES
The posterior pituitary, or neurohypophysis, is composed of modified glial cells (termed pituicytes) and axonal pro-
cesses extending from nerve cell bodies in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus.

The hypo -
thalamic neurons produce two peptides: antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin. They are stored in axon terminals in the neurohypophysis and released into the circulation in response to appropriate stimuli. Oxytocin stimulates the contraction of smooth muscle in the preg -
nant uterus and of muscle surrounding the lactiferous ducts of the mammary glands. Impairment of oxytocin synthesis and release has not been associated with signifi -
cant clinical abnormalities.

The clinically important poste-rior pituitary syndromes involve ADH production. They include diabetes insipidus and secretion of inappropriately high levels of ADH. ADH is a nonapeptide hormone synthesized predomi-
nantly in the supraoptic nucleus. In response to several 
THYROID
The thyroid gland consists of two bulky lateral lobes con -
nected by a relatively thin isthmus, usually located below and anterior to the larynx.

The thyroid gland develops embryologically from an evagination of the developing pharyngeal epithelium that descends from the foramen cecum at the base of the tongue to its normal position in the anterior neck. This pattern of descent explains the occa -
sional presence of ectopic thyroid tissue, most commonly 
located at the base of the tongue (lingual thyroid) or at other sites abnormally high in the neck.

The thyroid is divided into lobules, each composed of 
about 20 to 40 evenly dispersed follicles. The follicles range from uniform to variable in size and are lined by cuboidal to low columnar epithelium, which is filled with thyroglobulin, the iodinated precursor protein of active thyroid hormone. In response to trophic factors from the hypothalamus, TSH (also called thyrotropin) is released by 
thyrotrophs in the anterior pituitary into the circulation.

The binding of TSH to its receptor on the thyroid follicular epithelium results in activation and conformational change in the receptor, allowing it to associate with a stimulatory G protein (Fig. 19–5). Activation of the G protein eventually results in an increase in intracellular c AMP levels, which stimulates thyroid hormone synthesis and release medi -
ated by c AMP-dependent protein kinases. Thyroid follicu -
lar epithelial cells convert thyroglobulin into thyroxine (T
4.

and lesser amounts of triiodothyronine (T 3). T 4 and T 3 are 
released into the systemic circulation, where most of these

Clinical recognition of diseases of the thyroid is impor -
tant, because most are amenable to medical or surgical 
management. Such diseases include conditions associated with excessive release of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroid -
ism), those associated with thyroid hormone deficiency (hypothyroidism), and mass lesions of the thyroid.

Consid-ered next are the clinical consequences of disturbed thyroid function, followed by an overview of the disorders that generate these problems. HYPERTHYROIDISM
Thyrotoxicosis is a hypermetabolic state due to elevated circulating levels of free T
3 and T 4. Because it is caused most 
commonly by hyperfunction of the thyroid gland, thyro -
toxicosis often is referred to as hyperthyroidism.

In certain conditions, however, the oversupply either is related to excessive release of pre-formed thyroid hormone (e.g., in thyroiditis) or comes from an extrathyroidal source, rather than a hyperfunctioning gland (Table 19–2). Thus, strictly 
speaking, hyperthyroidism is only one (albeit the most common) category of thyrotoxicosis. Despite this clear distinction, the following discussion adheres to the common practice 
of using the terms thyrotoxicosis and hyperthyroidism 
interchangeably.

The clinical manifestations of thyrotoxicosis are truly 
protean and include changes referable to the hypermetabolic 
state induced by excessive amounts of thyroid hormone as well as those related to overactivity of the sympathetic nervous 
system:
- Constitutional symptoms: The skin of thyrotoxic persons tends to be soft, warm, and flushed; heat intolerance and 
excessive sweating are common. Increased sympathetic activity and hypermetabolism result in weight loss despite 
increased appetite.

- Gastrointestinal: Stimulation of the gut results in hyper -
motility, malabsorption, and diarrhea. - Cardiac: Palpitations and tachycardia are common; elderly patients may develop congestive heart failure 
peptides are reversibly bound to circulating plasma pro -
teins, such as T
4-binding globulin, for transport to periph -
eral tissues.

The binding proteins serve to maintain the serum unbound ( free) T
3 and T 4 concentrations within 
narrow limits while ensuring that the hormones are readily available to the tissues. In the periphery the majority of free T
4 is deiodinated to T 3; the latter binds to thyroid hormone 
nuclear receptors in target cells with 10-fold greater affinity than that observed for T
4 and has proportionately greater 
activity.

The interaction of thyroid hormone with its nuclear 
thyroid hormone receptor (TR) results in the formation of a hormone-receptor complex that binds to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in target genes, regulating their transcription. Thyroid hormone has diverse cellular effects, including upregulation of carbohydrate and lipid catabolism and stimulation of protein synthesis in a wide range of cells. The net result of these processes is an increase in the basal metabolic rate.

Figure  19–5 Homeostasis in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis 
and mechanism of action of thyroid hormones. Secretion of thyroid 
hormones (T 3 and T 4) is controlled by trophic factors secreted by both 
the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of T 3 and 
T4 stimulate the release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from 
the hypothalamus and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the ante-rior pituitary, causing T
3 and T 4 levels to rise.

Elevated T 3 and T 4 levels, 
in turn, suppress the secretion of both TRH and TSH. This relationship is termed a negative-feedback loop. TSH binds to the TSH receptor on the thyroid follicular epithelium, which causes activation of G proteins, release of cyclic AMP (c AMP), and c AMP-mediated synthesis and release of thyroid hormones (i.e., T
3 and T 4).

In the periphery, T 3 and T 4 interact 
with the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and form a complex that trans -
locates to the nucleus and binds to so-called thyroid response elements (TREs) on target genes, thereby initiating transcription.

723 Hypothyroidism
combination of TSH and free thyroid hormone assays, 
measurement of radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid gland often is valuable in determining the etiology. For example, such scans may show diffusely increased (whole-gland) uptake in Graves disease, increased uptake in a solitary nodule in toxic adenoma, or decreased uptake in thyroiditis.

HYPOTHYROIDISM
Hypothyroidism is caused by any structural or functional derangement that interferes with the production of ade -
quate levels of thyroid hormone. As in the case of hyper -
thyroidism, this disorder is sometimes divided into primary and secondary categories, depending on whether the hypo -
thyroidism arises from an intrinsic abnormality in the thyroid or from hypothalamic or pituitary disease ( Table 
19–3).

Worldwide, the most common cause of hypothy -
roidism is dietary deficiency of iodine (see further on), while in most developed nations, autoimmune causes pre -
dominate. Genetic defects that perturb thyroid develop -
ment itself ( thyroid dysgenesis) or the synthesis of thyroid 
hormone (dyshormonogenetic goiter) are relatively rare. The clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism include 
cretinism and myxedema. - Cretinism refers to hypothyroidism developing in infancy or early childhood.

This disorder formerly was fairly common in areas of the world where dietary iodine defi -
ciency is endemic, including mountainous areas such as the Himalayas and the Andes (endemic cretinism). It is now much less frequent because of the widespread sup -
plementation of foods with iodine. By contrast, enzyme defects that interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis are a cause of sporadic cretinism.

Clinical features of cre -
tinism include impaired development of the skeletal system and central nervous system, with severe mental retardation, short stature, coarse facial features, a pro -
truding tongue, and umbilical hernia. The severity of the as a consequence of aggravation of preexisting heart disease. - Neuromuscular: Patients frequently experience nervous -
ness, tremor, and irritability. Nearly 50% develop proxi -
mal muscle weakness (thyroid myopathy).

- Ocular manifestations: a wide, staring gaze and lid lag are present because of sympathetic overstimulation of the levator palpebrae superioris (Fig. 19–6). However, true thyroid ophthalmopathy associated with proptosis is a feature seen only in Graves disease (discussed later). - Thyroid storm is used to designate the abrupt onset of severe hyperthyroidism.

This condition occurs most commonly in patients with underlying Graves disease, probably resulting from an acute elevation in catechol -
amine levels, as might be encountered during stress. Thyroid storm constitutes a medical emergency: A sig-nificant number of untreated patients die of cardiac arrhythmias. - Apathetic hyperthyroidism refers to thyrotoxicosis occur -
ring in elderly persons, in whom the typical features of thyroid hormone excess seen in younger patients are blunted.

In these patients the diagnosis is often made during laboratory workup for unexplained weight loss or worsening cardiovascular disease. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is based on clinical 
features and laboratory data. The measurement of serum TSH 
is the most useful single screening test for hyperthyroidism, 
because TSH levels are decreased even at the earliest stages, when the disease may still be subclinical.

In rare cases of pituitary- or hypothalamus-associated (secondary) hyper -
thyroidism, TSH levels are either normal or raised. A low TSH value usually is associated with increased levels of free T
4. In the occasional patient, hyperthyroidism results 
predominantly from increased circulating levels of T 3 (T 3 
toxicosis). In such cases, free T 4 levels may be decreased, 
and direct measurement of serum T 3 may be useful.

Once 
the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis has been confirmed by a Figure  19–6 Patient with hyperthyroidism. A wide-eyed, staring gaze, 
caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, is one of the 
classic features of this disorder. In Graves disease, one of the most important causes of hyperthyroidism, accumulation of loose connective tissue behind the orbits also adds to the protuberant appearance of the eyes.

autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland. It is most 
prevalent between the ages of 45 and 65 years and is more common in women than in men, with female predomi-nance in a ratio of 10:1 to 20:1. Although it is primarily a disease of older women, it can occur in children and is a major cause of nonendemic goiter in children.mental impairment in cretinism seems to be directly influenced by the timing of onset of the deficient state in utero.

Normally, maternal hormones that are critical to fetal brain development, including T
3 and T 4, cross 
the placenta. If maternal thyroid deficiency is present before the development of the fetal thyroid gland, mental retardation is severe. By contrast, reduction in maternal thyroid hormones later in pregnancy, after 
the fetal thyroid has developed, allows normal brain development. - Hypothyroidism developing in older children and 
adults results in a condition known as myxedema.

Myxedema, or Gull disease, was first linked with 
thyroid dysfunction in 1873 by Sir William Gull in a paper addressing the development of a cretinoid state in 
adults. Manifestations of myxedema include general -
ized apathy and mental sluggishness that in the early stages of disease may mimic depression. Patients with myxedema are listless, cold intolerant, and often obese.

Mucopolysaccharide-rich edematous fluid accumulates in skin, subcutaneous tissue, and a number of visceral sites, with resultant broadening and coarsening of facial features, enlargement of the tongue, and deepening of the voice. Bowel motility is decreased, resulting in con -
stipation. Pericardial effusions are common; in later stages, the heart is enlarged, and heart failure may supervene. Laboratory evaluation has a vital role in the diagnosis of suspected hypothyroidism.

As in the case of hyperthyroid -
ism, measurement of serum TSH is the most sensitive screening 
test for this disorder. The serum TSH is increased in primary 
hypothyroidism because of a loss of feedback inhibition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and TSH production by the hypothalamus and pituitary, respectively. The TSH concentration is not increased in persons with hypothy -
roidism caused by primary hypothalamic or pituitary disease.

Serum T
4 is decreased in patients with hypothy -
roidism of any origin. THYROIDITIS
Thyroiditis, or inflammation of the thyroid gland, encom-passes a diverse group of disorders characterized by some form of thyroid inflammation.

These diseases include con -
ditions that result in acute illness with severe thyroid pain (e.g., infectious thyroiditis, granulomatous [de Quervain] thyroiditis) and disorders in which relatively little inflam -
mation occurs and the illness is manifested primarily by thyroid dysfunction (subacute lymphocytic [“painless”] thyroiditis and fibrous [Reidel] thyroiditis).

This section focuses on the more common and clinically significant types of thyroiditis: (1) Hashimoto thyroiditis (or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis); (2) granulomatous (de Quervain) thyroiditis; and (3) subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis. Chronic Lymphocytic (Hashimoto) Thyroiditis
Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroid -
ism in areas of the world where iodine levels are sufficient.

It is 
characterized by gradual thyroid failure secondary to MORPHOLOGY
The thyroid usually is diffusely and symmetrically enlarged, although more localized enlargement may be seen in some cases. The cut surface is pale and gray-tan in appearance, and the tissue is firm and somewhat friable. Microscopic examina -
tion reveals widespread infiltration of the parenchyma by a 
mononuclear  inflammatory  infiltrate containing small 
lymphocytes, plasma cells, and well-developed germinal  
centers (Fig.

19–8). The thyroid follicles are atrophic and are lined in many areas by epithelial cells distinguished by the presence of abundant eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, termed Hürthle, or 
oxyphil,  cells.

This is a metaplastic 
response of the normally low cuboidal follicular epithelium to ongoing injury; on ultrastructural examination, the 
Hürthle cells are characterized by numerous prominent 
PATHOGENESIS
Hashimoto thyroiditis is caused by a breakdown in self-
tolerance (Chapter 4) to thyroid autoantigens.

Thus, circu -
lating autoantibodies against thyroid antigens are present in the vast majority of patients, who demonstrate progressive depletion of thyroid epithelial cells (thyrocytes) and their replacement by mononuclear cell infiltration and fibrosis. The inciting events leading to breakdown in self-tolerance have not been fully elucidated, but multiple immunologic mecha -
nisms that may contribute to thyrocyte damage have been identified (Fig.

19–7), including
- CD8+  cytotoxic  T cell–mediated  cell death: CD8+ 
cytotoxic T cells may cause thyrocyte destruction. - Cytokine-mediated  cell death: Excessive T cell acti -
vation leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon- γ in the thyroid gland, with resultant 
recruitment and activation of macrophages and damage to follicles.

- Binding of antithyroid  antibodies (antithyroglob u lin, 
and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies), followed by anti -
body-dependent cell–mediated cytotoxicity (Chapter 4). A significant genetic component to the disease pathogenesis is supported by the concordance of disease in as many as 
40% of monozygotic twins, as well as the presence of cir -
culating antithyroid antibodies in approximately 50% of 
asymptomatic siblings of affected patients.

Increased sus -
ceptibility to Hashimoto thyroiditis is associated with 
polymorphisms in multiple immune regulation–associated genes, the most significant of which is the linkage to 
cytotoxic  T lymphocyte–associated  antigen-4 gene 
(CTLA4), which codes for a negative regulator of T cell func -
tion (Chapter 4).

## Page 739

725 Thyroiditis
but in some cases it may be sufficiently localized to raise 
suspicion for neoplasm. In the usual clinical course, hypo -
thyroidism develops gradually. In some cases, however, 
it may be preceded by transient thyrotoxicosis caused by dis -
ruption of thyroid follicles, with secondary release of thyroid hormones ( hashitoxicosis). During this phase, free 
T
4 and T 3 concentrations are elevated, TSH is diminished, 
and radioactive iodine uptake is decreased.

As hypothy -
roidism supervenes, T 4 and T 3 levels progressively fall, 
accompanied by a compensatory increase in TSH. Patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis often have other autoimmune 
diseases and are at increased risk for the development of B cell 
non-Hodgkin lymphomas (Chapter 11), which typically arise within the thyroid gland.

The relationship between Hashi -
moto disease and thyroid epithelial cancers remains con -
troversial, with some morphologic and mole cular studies 
suggesting a predisposition to papillary carcinomas. Subacute Granulomatous 
(de Quervain) Thyroiditis
Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, also known as de Quervain thyroiditis, is much less common than Hashi -
moto disease.

De Quervain thyroiditis is most common between the ages of 30 and 50 and, like other forms of thyroiditis, occurs more frequently in women than in men. Subacute thyroiditis is believed to be caused by a viral infection or an inflammatory process triggered by viral infections. A majority of patients have a history of an upper respiratory infection just before the onset of thyroiditis.

By contrast with auto immune thyroid disease, the 
immune response is not self-perpetuating, so the process is limited. Thyroid

may be abundant.

Less commonly, the thyroid is small and atrophic as a result of more extensive fibrosis 
(fibrosing  
variant). Unlike in Reidel thyroiditis, the fibrosis does not extend beyond the capsule of the gland. Clinical Features
Hashimoto thyroiditis comes to clinical attention as pain -

GRAVES DISEASE
In 1835 Robert Graves reported on his observations of a 
disease characterized by “violent and long continued pal-pitations in females” associated with enlargement of the thyroid gland. Graves disease is the most common cause of 
endogenous hyperthyroidism. It is characterized by a triad of 
manifestations:
- Thyrotoxicosis, caused by a diffusely enlarged, hyper -
functional thyroid, is present in all cases.

- An infiltrative ophthalmopathy with resultant exophthal-
mos is noted in as many as 40% of patients. - A localized, infiltrative dermopathy (sometimes desig -
nated pretibial myxedema) is seen in a minority of cases. Graves disease has a peak incidence between the ages of 20 and 40, with women being affected up to seven times more 
commonly than men. This very common disorder is esti-mated to affect 1.5% to 2.0% of women in the United States.

Genetic factors are important in the causation of Graves disease; the incidence is increased in relatives of affected patients, and the concordance rate in monozygotic twins is as high as 60%. As with other autoimmune disorders, a genetic susceptibility to Graves disease is associated with the presence of certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes, specifically HLA-DR3, and polymorphisms in genes encoding the inhibitory T cell receptor CTLA-4 and the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN22.

Clinical Features
The onset of this form of thyroiditis often is acute, charac -
terized by pain in the neck (particularly with swallowing), 
fever, malaise, and variable enlargement of the thyroid. Transient hyperthyroidism may occur, as in other cases of thyroiditis, as a result of disruption of thyroid follicles and release of excessive thyroid hormone. The leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rates are increased.

With progression of disease and gland destruction, a transient hypothyroid phase may ensue. The condition typically is self-limited, with most patients returning to a euthyroid state within 6 to 8 weeks. Subacute Lymphocytic Thyroiditis
Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis also is known as silent 
or painless thyroiditis; in a subset of patients the onset 
of disease follows pregnancy ( postpartum thyroiditis).

This 
disease is most likely to be autoimmune in etiology, because circulating antithyroid antibodies are found in a majority of patients. It mostly affects middle-aged women, who present with a painless neck mass or features of thyroid 
hormone excess. The initial phase of thyrotoxicosis (which is likely to be secondary to thyroid tissue damage) is fol -
lowed by return to a euthyroid state within a few months.

In a minority of affected persons the condition eventually progresses to hypothyroidism. Except for possible mild symmetric enlargement, the thyroid appears normal on gross inspection. The histologic features consist of lympho-cytic infiltration and hyperplastic germinal centers within the thyroid parenchyma. Other Forms of Thyroiditis
Riedel thyroiditis, a rare disorder of unknown etiology, is characterized by extensive fibrosis involving the thyroid and contiguous neck structures.

Clinical evaluation dem -
onstrates a hard and fixed thyroid mass, simulating a thyroid neoplasm. It may be associated with idiopathic fibrosis in other sites in the body, such as the retroperito -
neum. The presence of circulating antithyroid antibodies in most patients suggests an autoimmune etiology. PATHOGENESIS

body that binds to the TSH receptor and mimics the action of TSH, stimulating adenyl cyclase, with resultant increased release of thyroid hormones. Almost all persons with Graves disease have detectable amounts of this auto -
antibody, which is relatively specific for Graves disease.

SUMMARY
Thyroiditis
- Chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis is the most 
common cause of hypothyroidism in regions where dietary iodine levels are sufficient. MORPHOLOGY
The gland is firm, with an intact capsule, and may be unilater -
ally or bilaterally enlarged.

Histologic examination reveals disruption of thyroid follicles, with extravasation of colloid leading to a polymorphonuclear infiltrate, which is replaced over time by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. The extravasated colloid provokes an exuberant granuloma -
tous reaction with giant cells, some containing fragments of colloid. Healing occurs by resolution of inflammation and fibrosis.

- Hashimoto th yroiditis is an autoimmune disease charac ­
terized by progressive destruction of thyroid parenchyma, Hürthle cell change, and mononuclear (lymphoplasma­cytic) infiltrates, with or without extensive fibrosis. - Multiple autoimmune mechanisms account for Hashimoto 
disease, including cytotoxicity mediated by CD8 + T cells, 
cytokines (IFN ­γ), and antithyroid antibodies.

- Subacute gran ulomatous (de Quervain) thyroiditis is a 
self­limited disease, probably secondary to a viral infection, 
and is characterized by pain and the presence of a granu ­
lomatous inflammation in the thyroid. - Subacute l ymphocytic thyroiditis is a self ­limited disease 
that often occurs after a pregnancy (postpartum thyroid­itis), typically is painless, and is characterized by lympho ­
cytic inflammation in the thyroid.

727 Graves Disease
Clinical Features
The clinical manifestations of Graves disease include those 
common to all forms of thyrotoxicosis (discussed earlier), as well as those associated uniquely with Graves disease: diffuse hyperplasia of the thyroid, ophthalmopathy, and der-
mopathy. The degree of thyrotoxicosis varies from case to case, and the related changes may sometimes be less con -
spicuous than other manifestations of the disease.

Increased flow of blood through the hyperactive gland often pro -
duces an audible bruit. Sympathetic overactivity produces a characteristic wide, staring gaze and lid lag. The ophthal -
mopathy of Graves disease results in abnormal protrusion of the eyeball (exophthalmos). The extraocular muscles often are weak. The exophthalmos may persist or progress despite successful treatment of the thyrotoxicosis, some -
times resulting in corneal injury.

The infiltrative dermopa -
thy, or pretibial myxedema, most commonly involves the skin overlying the shins, where it manifests as scaly thick -
ening and induration of the skin. The skin lesions may be slightly pigmented papules or nodules and often have an orange peel texture. Laboratory findings in Graves disease include elevated serum free T
4 and T 3 and depressed serum 
TSH.

Because of ongoing stimulation of the thyroid follicles 
by TSIs, radioactive iodine uptake is increased, and radio -
iodine scans show a diffuse uptake of iodine. Autoimmune disorders of the thyroid thus span a continuum 
on which Graves disease, characterized by hyperfunction of the thyroid, lies at one extreme and Hashimoto disease, manifesting as hypothyroidism, occupies the other end.

Sometimes hyper-thyroidism may supervene on preexisting Hashimoto thy -
roiditis (hashitoxicosis), while at other times persons with Graves disease may spontaneously develop thyroid hypo -
function; occasionally, Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves disease may coexist within an affected kindred.

Not sur-prisingly, there is also an element of histologic overlap between the autoimmune thyroid disorders (most charac -
teristically, prominent intrathyroidal lymphoid cell infil -
trates with germinal center formation). In both disorders, the frequency of other autoimmune diseases, such as sys -
temic lupus erythematosus, pernicious anemia, type 1 dia -
betes, and Addison disease, is increased.

MORPHOLOGY
In the typical case of Graves disease, the thyroid gland is enlarged (usually symmetrically) due to 
diffuse  hypertro -
phy and hyperplasia of thyroid follicular epithelial cells. The gland is usually smooth and soft, and its capsule is intact. On microscopic examination, the follicular epithelial cells in untreated cases are tall, columnar, and more crowded than usual. This crowding often results in the formation of small papillae, which project into the follicular lumen ( Fig. 19–9).

Such papillae lack fibrovascular cores, in contrast with those of papillary carcinoma. The colloid within the follicular lumen is pale, with scalloped margins. Lymphoid infiltrates, consist -
ing predominantly of T cells, with fewer B cells and mature plasma cells, are present throughout the interstitium; germi -
nal centers are common. Changes in extrathyroidal tissues include generalized lym -
phoid hyperplasia.

In persons with ophthalmopathy, the 
have been implicated in the proliferation of thyroid follicu -
lar epithelium. - TSH-binding  inhibitor  immunoglobulins: These 
anti-TSH receptor antibodies prevent TSH from binding to its receptor on thyroid epithelial cells and in so doing may actually inhibit thyroid cell function.

The coexistence 
of stimulating and inhibiting immunoglobulins in the serum 
of the same patient is not unusual—a finding that may explain why some patients with Graves disease spontane -
ously develop episodes of hypothyroidism. A T cell–mediated autoimmune phenomenon also is involved in the development of the 
infiltrative  ophthalmopathy 
characteristic of Graves disease.

In Graves ophthalmopathy, the volume of the retroorbital connective tissues and extra -
ocular muscles is increased as a result of several causes, including (1) marked infiltration of the retroorbital space by mononuclear cells, predominantly T cells; (2) inflammatory edema and swelling of extraocular muscles; (3) accumulation of extracellular matrix components, specifically hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate; and (4) increased numbers of adipocytes (fatty infil -
tration).

These changes displace the eyeball forward, poten -
tially interfering with the function of the extraocular muscles. tissues of the orbit are edematous because of the presence of hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans. In addition, there is infil -
tration by lymphocytes, mostly T cells. Orbital muscles ini -
tially are edematous but may undergo fibrosis late in the course of the disease.

The dermopathy, if present, is charac-terized by thickening of the dermis, as a result of deposition of glycosaminoglycans and lymphocyte infiltration. Figure  19–9 Graves disease. The thyroid is diffusely hyperplastic. The 
follicles are lined by tall columnar epithelial cells that project into the 
lumina. These cells actively resorb the colloid in the centers of the folli -
cles, resulting in the “scalloped” appearance of the edges of the colloid.

SUMMARY
Graves Disease
- Graves disease, the most common cause of endogenous 
hyperthyroidism, is characterized by the triad of thyro ­
toxicosis, ophthalmopathy, and dermopathy.

MORPHOLOGY
In most cases, TSH-induced hypertrophy and hyperplasia of 
thyroid follicular cells result initially in diffuse, symmetric enlargement of the gland 
(diffuse  goiter). The follicles are 
lined by crowded columnar cells, which may pile up and form projections similar to those seen in Graves disease.

If dietary iodine subsequently increases, or if the demands for thyroid hormone decrease, the stimulated follicular epithelium invo -
lutes to form an enlarged, colloid-rich gland 
(colloid  goiter). The cut surface of the thyroid in such cases usually is brown, somewhat glassy-appearing, and translucent. On microscopic examination, the follicular epithelium may be hyperplastic in the early stages of disease or flattened and cuboidal during periods of involution.

Colloid is abundant during the latter periods. With time, recurrent episodes of hyperplasia and involution combine to produce a more irregular enlargement of the thyroid, termed 
multinodular  goiter. Virtually all 
long-standing diffuse goiters convert into multinodular goiters.

Multinodular goiters typically are hormonally silent, although a minority (approximately 10% over 10 years) can manifest with thyrotoxicosis secondary to the development of autonomous nodules that produce thyroid hormone 
independent of TSH stimulation. This condition, known as toxic multinodular goiter or 
Plummer  syndrome, is not 
accompanied by the infiltrative ophthalmopathy and der-mopathy of Graves disease–associated thyrotoxicosis.

Multinodular goiters are multilobulate, asymmetrically 
enlarged glands, which may attain massive size. On cut surface, irregular nodules containing variable amounts of brown, gelatinous colloid are evident ( Fig. 19–10, A). Older 
lesions often show areas of fibrosis, hemorrhage, calcifica-tion, and cystic change.

The microscopic appearance includes colloid-rich follicles lined by flattened, inactive epithelium 
and areas of follicular epithelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia, accompanied by the regressive changes just noted ( Fig. 19–10, B). DIFFUSE AND MULTINODULAR 
GOITER
Enlargement of the thyroid, or goiter, is the most common 
manifestation of thyroid disease. Diffuse and multinodular 
goiters reflect impaired synthesis of thyroid hormone, most often 
caused by dietary iodine deficiency.

Impairment of thyroid hormone synthesis leads to a compensatory rise in the serum TSH, which in turn causes hypertrophy and hyper -
plasia of thyroid follicular cells and, ultimately, gross enlargement of the thyroid gland. The compensatory increase in functional mass of the gland is enough to over -
come the hormone deficiency, ensuring a euthyroid meta-
bolic state in the vast majority of affected persons.

If the underlying disorder is sufficiently severe (e.g., a congenital biosynthetic defect), the compensatory responses may be inadequate to overcome the impairment in hormone syn-thesis, resulting in goitrous hypothyroidism. The degree of 
thyroid enlargement is proportional to the level and dura -
tion of thyroid hormone deficiency. Goiters can be endemic or sporadic. - Endemic goiter occurs in geographic areas where the soil, water, and food supply contain little iodine.

The desig-nation endemic is used when goiters are present in more 
than 10% of the population in a given region. Such con -
ditions are particularly common in mountainous areas of the world, including the Himalayas and the Andes. With increasing availability of dietary iodine supple -
mentation, the frequency and severity of endemic goiter have declined significantly. - Sporadic goiter occurs less commonly than endemic goiter.

The condition is more common in females than in males, with a peak incidence in puberty or young adulthood, when there is an increased physiologic demand for T
4. Sporadic goiter may be caused by several 
conditions, including the ingestion of substances that interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis at some level, such as excessive calcium and vegetables belonging to the Brassicaceae (also called Cruciferae) family (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, turnips).

In other instances, goiter may result from hereditary enzymatic defects that interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis (dyshormonogenetic goiter). In most cases, however, the cause of sporadic goiter is not apparent. Clinical Features
The dominant clinical features of goiter are those caused by the mass effects of the enlarged gland.

In addition to the 
obvious cosmetic problem of a large neck mass, goiters also may cause airway obstruction, dysphagia, and compres -
sion of large vessels in the neck and upper thorax (so-called superior vena cava syndrome ). As stated, a hyperfunctioning 
(toxic) nodule may develop within a long-standing goiter, resulting in hyperthyroidism.

The incidence of malignancy 
in long-standing multinodular goiters is low (less than 5%) but not zero, and concern for malignancy arises with goiters that demonstrate sudden changes in size or associated symptoms (e.g., hoarseness). NEOPLASMS OF THE THYROID
The thyroid gland gives rise to a variety of neoplasms, ranging from circumscribed, benign adenomas to highly aggressive, anaplastic carcinomas.

From a clinical stand-point, the possibility of a tumor is of major concern in patients who present with thyroid nodules. Fortunately, the 
overwhelming majority of solitary nodules of the thyroid • Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder caused by 
autoantibodies to the TSH receptor that mimic TSH action and activate TSH receptors on thyroid epithelial cells.

- The thyroid in Graves disease is characterized by diffuse 
hypertrophy and hyperplasia of follicles and lymphoid 
infiltrates; glycosaminoglycan deposition and lymphoid infiltrates are responsible for the ophthalmopathy and dermopathy. - Laboratory features include elevations in serum free T 3 
and T 4 and decreased serum TSH.

prove to be either follicular adenomas or localized, 
non-neoplastic conditions (e.g., a dominant nodule in mul-
tinodular goiter, simple cysts, or foci of thyroiditis). Carci -
nomas of the thyroid, by contrast, are uncommon, accounting for much less than 1% of solitary thyroid nodules.

Several clinical criteria provide a clue to the nature of a given thyroid nodule:
- Solitary nodules, in general, are more likely to be neoplas -
tic than are multiple nodules. - Nodules in younger patients are more likely to be neoplas -
tic than are those in older patients. - Nodules in males are more likely to be neoplastic than are 
those in females. - A history of radiation treatment to the head and neck 
region is associated with an increased incidence of thyroid malignancy.

- Nodules that take up radioactive iodine in imaging 
studies (hot nodules) are more likely to be benign than malignant, reflecting well-differentiated cells. Such statistics and general trends, however, are of little significance in the evaluation of a given patient, in whom the timely recognition of a malignancy, however uncom-mon, can be lifesaving.

Ultimately, it is the morphologic evaluation of a given thyroid nodule by fine needle aspira -
tion, combined with histologic study of surgically resected thyroid parenchyma, that provides the most definitive information about its nature. This section presents an over-view of the major thyroid neoplasms, including adenomas and carcinomas of various types. Adenomas
Adenomas of the thyroid are benign neoplasms derived from follicular epithelium.

As in the case of all thyroid neoplasms, follicular adenomas usually are solitary. On clinical and morphologic grounds, they may be difficult 
to distinguish from a dominant nodule in multinodular goiter, for example, or from the less common follicular carcinomas. Although the vast majority of adenomas are nonfunctional, a small proportion produce thyroid hor -
mones (toxic adenomas), causing clinically apparent thyro -
toxicosis.

In general, follicular adenomas are not forerunners to carcinomas; nevertheless, shared genetic alterations support the possibility that at least a subset of follicular carcinomas arise in preexisting adenomas (see further on). PATHOGENESIS
The TSH receptor signaling pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of toxic adenomas.

Activating (gain- 
of-function) somatic mutations in one of two components of this signaling system—most often the gene encoding the TSH receptor itself (TSHR) and, less commonly, the α-subunit of 
G
s (GNAS)—allow follicular cells to secrete thyroid hormone 
independent of TSH stimulation (thyroid autonomy). The result of this overabundance is symptomatic hyperthyroid -
ism, with a “hot” thyroid nodule seen on imaging studies.

Overall, somatic mutations in the TSH receptor signaling pathway seem to be present in slightly over half of toxic adenomas. Not surprisingly, such mutations also are observed in a subset of autonomous nodules that give rise to toxic multinodular goiters, as described earlier.

A minority of non-functioning follicular adenomas (less than 20%) exhibit muta -
tions of RAS or phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PIK3CA), or bear a PAX8/PPARG fusion gene, all of which are genetic 
alterations shared with follicular carcinomas. These are dis -
cussed in further detail under “Carcinomas” (see further on). MORPHOLOGY
The typical thyroid adenoma is a solitary, spherical lesion 
that compresses the adjacent non-neoplastic thyroid.

The neoplastic cells are demarcated from the adjacent paren-chyma by a 
well-defined,  intact  capsule (Fig. 19–11, A). These  features  are important  in making  the distinc -
tion from  multinodular  goiters, which contain multiple 
nodules on their cut surface (even though the patient may present clinically with a solitary dominant nodule), do not demonstrate compression of the adjacent thyroid paren-chyma, and lack a well-formed capsule.

On microscopic examination, the constituent cells are arranged in uniform follicles that contain colloid (Fig. 19–11, B). Papillary growth

lated papillary carcinoma (discussed later). Occasionally, the 
neoplastic cells acquire brightly eosinophilic granular cyto -
plasm (oxyphil or Hürthle cell change) ( Fig. 19–12); the clini-
cal presentation and behavior of a Hürthle  cell adenoma 
are no different from those of a conventional adenoma.

Similar to endocrine tumors at other anatomic sites, even benign follicular adenomas may, on occasion, exhibit focal Clinical Features
Most adenomas of the thyroid manifest as painless 
nodules, often discovered during a routine physical exami -
nation. Larger masses may produce local symptoms 
such as difficulty in swallowing. As previously stated, persons with toxic adenomas can present with features 
of thyrotoxicosis.

After injection of radioactive iodine, 
most adenomas take up iodine less avidly than normal thyroid parenchyma. On radionuclide scanning, therefore, adenomas appear as cold nodules relative to the adjacent 
normal thyroid gland. Toxic adenomas, however, will appear as warm or hot nodules in the scan. As many as 10% 
of cold nodules eventually prove to be malignant. By con -
trast, malignancy is rare in hot nodules.

Essential tech -
niques used in the preoperative evaluation of suspected adenomas are ultrasonography and fine needle aspiration biopsy. Because of the need for evaluating capsular 
integrity, the definitive diagnosis of thyroid adenoma can be 
made only after careful histologic examination of the resected specimen. Suspected adenomas of the thyroid are therefore removed surgically to exclude malignancy. Thyroid adeno -
mas carry an excellent prognosis and do not recur or metastasize.

Carcinomas
Carcinomas of the thyroid are relatively uncommon in the United States, accounting for about 1.5% of all cancers. A female predominance has been noted among patients who develop thyroid carcinoma in the early and middle adult years. By contrast, cases manifesting in childhood and late adult life are distributed equally between males and females.

Most thyroid carcinomas (except medullary carci -
nomas) are derived from the thyroid follicular epithelium, and of these, the vast majority are well-differentiated lesions.

The major subtypes of thyroid carcinoma and their relative frequencies are
- Papillary carcinoma (accounting for more than 85% of 
cases)
- Follicular carcinoma (5% to 15% of cases)
- Anaplastic (undifferentiated) carcinoma (less than 5% of 
cases)
- Medullary carcinoma (5% of cases)
Because of the unique clinical and biologic features associ -
ated with each variant of thyroid carcinoma, these sub -
types are described separately.

Presented next is an overview of the molecular pathogenesis of all thyroid cancers.nuclear pleomorphism, atypia, and prominent nucleoli 
(endocrine  atypia); by themselves, these features do not 
constitute evidence of malignancy. The hallmark of all follicu -

capsule encircling the tumor.

integrity  of the capsule  is therefor e critical  in distin -

731 Neoplasms of the Thyroid
PATHOGENESIS
Both genetic and environmental factors are implicated in the 
pathogenesis of thyroid cancers. Genetic  Factors. Distinct molecular events are involved in 
the pathogenesis of the four major variants of thyroid cancer. As stated, medullary carcinomas do not arise from the follicu-lar epithelium.

Genetic alterations in the three follicular cell–derived malignancies are clustered along two oncogenic pathways—the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K)/AKT pathway (Fig. 19–13).

In normal cells, these pathways are transiently activated by binding of soluble growth factor ligands to the extracellular domain of receptor tyrosine kinases, which results in autophosphorylation of the cytoplas -
mic domain of the receptor, permitting intracellular signal transduction.

In thyroid carcinomas, as with many solid cancers ( Chapter 5 ), gain-of-function mutations along 
components of these pathways lead to constitutive 
activation even in the absence of ligand, thus promoting carcinogenesis. - Papillary  thyroid  carcinomas:  Activation  of the 
MAP  kinase  pathway  is a feature  of most  papillary  
carcinomas and can occur by one of two major mecha -
nisms.

The first mechanism involves rearrangements of RET or NTRK1 (neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 1), 
both of which encode transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases, and the second mechanism involves activating point mutations in BRAF, whose product is an intermediate 
signaling component in the MAP kinase pathway ( Fig.

19–13). The RET gene is not normally expressed in thyroid 
follicular cells. In papillary cancers, chromosomal rear-
rangements place the tyrosine kinase domain of RET 
under the transcriptional control of genes that are consti -
tutively expressed in the thyroid epithelium. The novel fusion proteins that are so formed are known as RET/PTC (papillary thyroid carcinoma) and are present in approxi -
mately 20% to 40% of papillary thyroid cancers.

The fre -
quency of RET/PTC rearrangements is significantly higher 
in papillary cancers arising in the backdrop of radiation exposure. Similarly, rearrangements of NTRK1 are present 
in 5% to 10% of papillary thyroid cancers, and the resultant fusion proteins are constitutively expressed in thyroid cells, leading to activation of MAP kinase pathways.

One third to one half of papillary thyroid carcinomas harbor a gain-of-function mutation in the BRAF gene, which most 
commonly is a valine-to-glutamate change on codon 600 (BRAF
V600E). Since chromosomal rearrangements of the 
RET or NTRK1 genes and mutations of BRAF have redun -
dant effects on the thyroid epithelium (both mechanisms result in activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway), papillary thyroid carcinomas demonstrate either one or the other molecular abnormality, but not both.

RET/PTC 
rearrangements and BRAF point mutations are not 
observed in follicular adenomas or carcinomas. - Follicular  thyroid  carcinomas: Approximately one 
third to one half of follicular thyroid carcinomas harbor 
mutations  in the PI-3K/AKT  signaling  pathway, 
resulting in constitutive activation of this oncogenic pathway.

This subset of tumors includes those with gain-of-function point mutations of RAS and PIK3CA, those with 
amplification of PIK3CA, and those with loss-of-function 
mutations of PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene and negative 
regulator of this pathway.

The progressive increase in the prevalence of RAS and PIK3CA mutations from benign fol-
licular adenomas to follicular carcinomas to anaplastic car-cinomas (see next) suggests a shared histogenesis and molecular evolution among these follicular cell–derived tumors. A unique (2;3)(q13;p25) translocation has been described in one third to one half of follicular carcinomas.

This translocation creates a fusion gene composed of por -
tions of PAX8, a paired homeobox gene that is important 
in thyroid development, and the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gene ( PPARG), whose gene product is 
a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in terminal dif -
ferentiation of cells. Less than 10% of follicular adenomas harbor PAX8/PPARG
 fusion  genes, and thus far these 
have not been documented in other thyroid neoplasms.

- Anaplastic  carcinomas: These highly aggressive and 
lethal tumors can arise de novo or, more commonly, by dedifferentiation of a well-differentiated papillary or follicular carcinoma. Molecular alterations present in ana -
plastic carcinomas include those also seen in well-differentiated carcinomas (e.g., RAS or PIK3CA mutations), 
albeit at a significantly higher rate, suggesting that the pres -
ence of these mutations might predispose existing thyroid neoplasms to transform.

Other genetic hits, such as inac-
tivation of TP53, are essentially restricted to anaplastic 
carcinomas and may also relate to their aggressive behavior. - Medullary  thyroid  carcinomas: In contrast with the 
subtypes described earlier, these neoplasms arise from the

ing to thyroid cancer is exposure to ionizing  radiation, 
particularly during the first 2 decades of life.

In keeping with this finding, there was a marked increase in the incidence of papillary carcinomas among children exposed to ionizing radiation after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. Defi-
ciency  of dietary  iodine (and by extension, an association 
with goiter) is linked with a higher frequency of follicular carcinomas. Papillary Carcinoma
As mentioned earlier, papillary carcinomas represent the most common form of thyroid cancer.

These tumors may occur at any age, and they account for the vast majority of thyroid carcinomas associated with previous exposure to ionizing radiation. A B

Papillary carcinomas may manifest as solitary or multifocal lesions within the thyroid.

In some cases, they may be well circumscribed and even encapsulated; in other instances, they infiltrate the adjacent parenchyma with ill-defined margins. The lesions may contain areas of fibrosis and calcification and often are cystic. On cut surface, they may appear granular and sometimes contain grossly discernible papillary foci (Fig. 19–14, A). The definitive diagnosis of papillary carcinoma can 
be made only after microscopic examination.

In current prac -
tice, 
the diagnosis  of papillary  carcinoma  is based  on 
nuclear  features even in the absence of a papillary archi-
tecture. The nuclei of papillary carcinoma cells contain very finely dispersed chromatin, which imparts an 
optically  clear 
appearance, giving rise to the designation ground  glass or 
“Orphan Annie eye” nuclei (Fig. 19–14, C and D).

In addition, 
invaginations of the cytoplasm may give the appearance of intranuclear inclusions (hence the designation pseudoinclu-
sions) in cross-sections. A 
papillary  architecture is 
common (Fig. 19–14, B); unlike hyperplastic papillary lesions 
seen in Graves disease, the neoplastic papillae have dense fibrovascular cores. Concentrically calcified structures termed 
psammoma  bodies often are present within the papillae.

Foci of lymphatic permeation by tumor cells are often present, but invasion of blood vessels is relatively uncom -
mon, particularly in smaller lesions. Metastases to adjacent cervical lymph nodes are estimated to occur in about half of

Clinical Features
Papillary carcinomas are nonfunctional tumors, so they 
manifest most often as a painless mass in the neck, either within the thyroid or as metastasis in a cervical lymph node. A preoperative diagnosis usually can be established by fine-needle aspiration on the basis of the characteristic nuclear features described earlier. Papillary carcinomas are indolent lesions, with 10-year survival rates in excess of 95%.

Of interest, the presence of isolated cervical nodal metastases does not seem to have a significant influence on the generally good prognosis of these lesions. In a minority of patients, hematogenous metastases are present at the time of diagnosis, most commonly to the lung.

The long-term survival of patients with papillary thyroid cancer is dependent on several factors, including age (in general, the prognosis is less favorable among patients older than 40 years), the presence of extrathyroidal extension, and pres -
ence of distant metastases (stage). Follicular Carcinoma
Follicular carcinomas account for 5% to 15% of primary thyroid cancers.

They are more common in women (occur -
ring in a ratio of 3:1) and manifest at an older age than that typical for papillary carcinomas, with a peak incidence between the ages of 40 and 60 years. Follicular carcinoma is more frequent in areas with dietary iodine deficiency (accounting for 25% to 40% of thyroid cancers), while its incidence has either decreased or remained stable in iodine-sufficient areas of the world.

MORPHOLOGY
On microscopic examination, most follicular carcinomas are composed of fairly uniform cells forming small follicles, remi -
niscent of normal thyroid ( Fig. 19–15); in other cases, follicu -
lar differentiation may be less apparent. As with follicular adenomas, Hürthle cell variants of follicular carcinomas may be seen. Follicular carcinomas may be 
widely  invasive, infil-
trating the thyroid parenchyma and extrathyroidal soft tissues, or 
minimally  invasive.

The latter type are sharply 
demarcated lesions that may be impossible to distinguish from follicular adenomas on gross examination. This dis-
tinction  requires  extensive  histologic  sampling  of 
the tumor  capsule–thyroid  interface,  to exclude  cap-
sular  and/or  vascular  invasion (Fig. 19–16). As men-
tioned earlier, follicular lesions in which the nuclear features are typical of papillary carcinomas should be regarded as 
follicular variants of papillary cancers.

lar lumina contain recognizable colloid. cases. There are over a dozen variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma, but the most common is one composed predomi-nantly or exclusively of follicles (
follicular  variant of papil-
lary thyroid carcinoma).

The follicular variant more frequently is encapsulated and is associated with a lower incidence of lymph node metastases and extrathyroidal extension than that typical for conventional papillary carcinomas. A B

licular carcinomas.

A, In adenomas, a fibrous capsule, usually thin but occasionally more prominent, surrounds the neoplastic follicles and no capsular 
invasion is seen ( arrows); compressed normal thyroid parenchyma usually is present external to the capsule ( top). B, By contrast, follicular carcinomas 
demonstrate capsular invasion (arrows) that may be minimal, as in this case, or widespread, with extension into local structures of the neck.

serotonin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Medul -
lary carcinomas arise sporadically in about 70% of cases. The 
remaining 30% are familial cases occurring in the setting of 
MEN syndrome 2A or 2B, or familial medullary thyroid 
carcinoma without an associated MEN syndrome, as dis -
cussed later. Of note, both familial and sporadic medullary forms demonstrate activating RET mutations.

Sporadic 
medullary carcinomas, as well as familial cases without an associated MEN syndrome, occur in adults, with a peak incidence in the fifth and sixth decades. Cases associated with MEN-2A or MEN-2B, by contrast, have been reported in younger patients, including children. Clinical Features
Follicular carcinomas manifest most frequently as solitary cold thyroid nodules. In rare cases, they may be hyperfunc -
tional.

These neoplasms tend to metastasize through the bloodstream (hematogenous dissemination) to the lungs, bone, and liver. In contrast with papillary carcinomas, regional nodal metastases are uncommon. As many as half of patients with widely invasive carcinomas succumb to their disease within 10 years, while less than 10% of patients with minimally invasive follicular carcinomas die within the same time span. Follicular carcinomas are treated with surgical excision.

Well-differentiated metastases may take up radioactive iodine, which can be used to identify and also ablate such lesions. Because better-differentiated lesions may be stimulated by TSH, patients usually are placed on a thyroid hormone regimen after surgery to sup -
press endogenous TSH. Anaplastic Carcinoma
Anaplastic carcinomas are undifferentiated tumors of the thyroid follicular epithelium, accounting for less than 5% of thyroid tumors.

They are aggressive, with a mortality rate approaching 100%. Patients with anaplastic carcinoma are older than those with other types of thyroid cancer, with a mean age of 65 years. Approximately a quarter of patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinomas have a past history of a well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, and another quarter harbor a concurrent well-differentiated tumor in the resected specimen.

MORPHOLOGY
Anaplastic carcinomas manifest as bulky masses that typically grow rapidly beyond the thyroid capsule into adjacent neck structures.

On microscopic examination, these neoplasms are composed of highly anaplastic cells, which may take 
on any of several histologic patterns, including those popu -
lated by
- Large, pleomorphic giant cells
- Spindle cells with a sarcomatous appearance
- Mixed spindle and giant cell lesions
Foci of papillary or follicular differentiation may be present in some tumors, suggesting origin from a better-differentiated carcinoma.

MORPHOLOGY
Medullary carcinomas may arise as a solitary nodule or may manifest as multiple lesions involving both lobes of the thyroid. Multicentricity is particularly common in familial 
cases. Larger lesions often contain areas of necrosis and hemorrhage and may extend through the capsule of the thyroid. On microscopic examination, medullary carcinomas are composed of polygonal to spindle-shaped cells, which may form nests, trabeculae, and even follicles.

Amyloid  
deposits, derived from altered calcitonin molecules, are present in the adjacent stroma in many cases ( Fig. 19–17) and 
are a distinctive feature. Calcitonin is readily demonstrable both within the cytoplasm of the tumor cells and in the stromal amyloid by immunohistochemical methods. Electron microscopy reveals variable numbers of intracytoplasmic membrane-bound, electron-dense granules ( Fig. 19–18).

One of the peculiar features of familial medullary carcinomas is the presence of 
multicentric  C cell hyperplasia in the 
surrounding thyroid parenchyma, a feature usually absent in sporadic lesions. Foci of C cell hyperplasia are believed to represent the precursor lesions from which medullary carci -
nomas arise. Clinical Features
Anaplastic carcinomas grow with wild abandon despite therapy.

Metastases to distant sites are common, but in most cases death occurs in less than 1 year as a result of aggressive local growth and compromise of vital structures in the neck. Medullary Carcinoma
Medullary carcinomas of the thyroid are neuroendocrine neoplasms derived from the parafollicular cells, or C cells, of the thyroid.

Like normal C cells, medullary carcinomas secrete calcitonin, the measurement of which plays an important role in the diagnosis and postoperative follow-up evaluation of patients. In some cases, the tumor cells elabo -
rate other polypeptide hormones such as somatostatin, 
Figure  19–17 Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. These tumors typi -
cally contain amyloid, visible here as homogeneous extracellular material, 
derived from calcitonin molecules secreted by the neoplastic cells.

Clinical Features
In the sporadic cases, medullary carcinoma manifests most 
often as a mass in the neck, sometimes associated with compression effects such as dysphagia or hoarseness. In

sites of storage of calcitonin and other peptides. (Original magnification ×30,000.) 
some instances, the initial manifestations are caused by the 
secretion of a peptide hormone (e.g., diarrhea caused by the secretion of VIP).

Screening of the patient’s relatives for elevated calcitonin levels or RET mutations permits early 
detection of tumors in familial cases.

As discussed at the end of this chapter, all members of MEN-2 kindreds carry -
ing RET mutations are offered prophylactic thyroidecto-
mies to preempt the development of medullary carcinomas; often, the only histologic finding in the resected thyroid of these asymptomatic carriers is the presence of C cell hyper -
plasia or small (less than 1 cm) micromedullary carcinomas. Recent studies have shown that specific RET mutations 
correlate with an aggressive behavior in medullary carcinomas.

SUMMARY
Thyroid Neoplasms
- Most thyroid neoplasms manifest as solitary thyroid nodules, 
but only 1% of all thyroid nodules are neoplastic. - Follicular adenomas are the most common benign neo ­
plasms, while papillary carcinoma is the most common malignancy. - Multiple genetic pathways are involved in thyroid carcino-
genesis.

Some of the genetic abnormalities that are fairly unique to thyroid cancers include PAX8/PPARG fusion 
(in follicular carcinoma), chromosomal rearrangements involving the RET oncogene (in papillary cancers), and 
mutations of RET (in medullary carcinomas). - Follicular adenomas and carcinomas both are composed of 
well­differentiated follicular epithelial cells; the latter are 
distinguished by evidence of capsular and/or vascular invasion.

- Papillary carcinomas are recognized based on nuclear fea ­
tures (ground glass nuclei, pseudoinclusions) even in the absence of papillae. These neoplasms typically metastasize by way of lymphatics, but the prognosis is excellent. - Anaplastic carcinomas are thought to arise by dedifferentia ­
tion of more differentiated neoplasms. They are highly aggressive, uniformly lethal cancers.

- Medullary cancers are nonepithelial neoplasms arising from the parafollicular C cells and can occur in either sporadic (70%) or familial (30%) settings. Multicentricity and C cell hyperplasia are features of familial cases. Amyloid deposits are a characteristic histologic finding. PARATHYROID  GLANDS
The parathyroid glands are derived from the developing pharyngeal pouches that also give rise to the thymus.

They normally lie in close proximity to the upper and lower poles of each thyroid lobe but may be found anywhere along the pathway of descent of the pharyngeal pouches, including the carotid sheath and the thymus and elsewhere in the anterior mediastinum. Most of the gland is com-posed of chief cells. On hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, 
the chief cells range from light to dark pink, depending on their glycogen content. They contain secretory granules of parathyroid hormone (PTH).

Oxyphil cells are found through-
out the normal parathyroid either singly or in small clus -
ters. They are slightly larger than the chief cells, have acidophilic cytoplasm, and are tightly packed with mito -
chondria. The activity of the parathyroid glands is controlled by 
the level of free (ionized) calcium in the bloodstream, rather than by trophic hormones secreted by the hypothalamus and pituitary.

Normally, decreased levels of free calcium stimulate the synthesis and secretion of PTH, with the following effects:
- Increase in renal tubular reabsorption of calcium
- Increase in urinary phosphate excretion, thereby lower -
ing serum phosphate levels (since phosphate binds to ionized calcium)• Increase in the conversion of vitamin D to its active 
dihydroxy form in the kidneys, which in turn augments gastrointestinal calcium absorption
- Enhancement of osteoclastic activity (i.e., bone resorp -
tion, thus releasing ionized calcium), mediated indi -
rectly by promoting the differentiation of osteoclast progenitor cells into mature osteoclasts
The net result of these activities is an increase in the level of free calcium, which inhibits further PTH secretion.

Abnormalities of the parathyroids include both hyperfunc -
tion and hypofunction. Tumors of the parathyroid glands, 
unlike thyroid tumors, usually come to attention because of excessive secretion of PTH, rather than mass effects. HYPERPARATHYROIDISM
Hyperparathyroidism occurs in two major forms, primary 
and secondary, and, less commonly, as tertiary hyperpara-
thyroidism.

The first condition represents an autonomous, spontaneous overproduction of PTH, while the latter two conditions typically occur as secondary phenomena in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.

PATHOGENESIS
Although the details of genetic alterations in sporadic para -
thyroid tumors are beyond the scope of this discussion, 
abnormalities in two specific genes are commonly associated with these tumors:
- Cyclin  D1 gene  inversions:  Cyclin D1 is a positive 
regulator of the cell cycle.

A chromosomal  inversion 
on chromosome 11 results in relocation of the cyclin D1 
gene (normally on 11q), so that it is now positioned adja-cent to the 5 ′-flanking region of the PTH gene (on 11p), 
leading to abnormal expression of cyclin D1 protein and increased proliferation. Between 10% and 20% of adeno -
mas have this clonal genetic defect.

In addition, cyclin D1 is overexpressed in approximately 40% of parathyroid adenomas, suggesting that mechanisms other than cyclin 
D1 gene inversion can lead to its overexpression. - MEN1  mutations: Approximately 20% to 30% of para -
thyroid tumors not associated with the MEN-1 syndrome have mutations in both copies of the MEN1 gene (see 
later). The spectrum of MEN1 mutations in the sporadic 
tumors is virtually identical to that in familial parathyroid adenomas.

Primary Hyperparathyroidism
Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine dis -
order, and an important cause of hypercalcemia. There has 
been a dramatic increase in the detection of cases in the latter half of the last century, mainly as a result of the routine inclusion of serum calcium assays in testing for a variety of clinical conditions that bring a patient to the hospital.

The frequency of occurrence of the various para -
thyroid lesions underlying the hyperfunction is as follows:
- Adenoma—85% to 95%
- Primary hyperplasia (diffuse or nodular)—5% to 10%
- Parathyroid carcinoma—1%
In more than 95% of cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a sporadic parathyroid adenoma or sporadic hyperplasia.

The genetic defects identified in familial 
primary hyperparathyroidism include multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes, specifically MEN-1 and MEN-2A (see further on). Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare cause of hyperparathyroidism, caused by inactivating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor gene on para -
thyroid cells, leading to constitutive PTH secretion.

MORPHOLOGY
The morphologic changes seen in primary hyperparathyroid -
ism include those in the parathyroid glands as well as those in other organs affected by elevated levels of calcium. In 75% to 80% of cases, one of the parathyroids harbors a solitary adenoma, which, like the normal parathyroids, may lie in close proximity to the thyroid gland or in an ectopic site (e.g., the mediastinum). The typical parathyroid adenoma is a well-circumscribed, soft, tan nodule, invested by a delicate capsule.

By definition,  parathyroid  adenomas  are almost  
invariably  confined  to single  glands (Fig. 19–19), and 
Figure  19–19 Technetium-99 radionuclide scan demonstrates an area 
of increased uptake corresponding to the left inferior parathyroid gland 
(arrow). This proved to be a parathyroid adenoma. Preoperative scintig-raphy is useful in localizing and distinguishing adenomas from parathyroid hyperplasia, in which more than one gland will demonstrate increased uptake.

the remaining glands are normal in size or somewhat 
shrunken, as a result of feedback inhibition by elevated serum calcium. Most parathyroid adenomas weigh between 0.5 and 5 g. On microscopic examination, parathyroid adenomas are composed predominantly of chief cells ( Fig. 19–20). In most 
cases, at least a few nests of larger oxyphil cells also are present. A rim of compressed, non-neoplastic parathyroid tissue, generally separated by a fibrous capsule, often is visible at the edge of the adenoma.

This finding constitutes a helpful internal control, since the chief cells of the adenoma are larger and show greater nuclear size variability than that typical for the normal chief cells. Cells with bizarre and pleo -
morphic nuclei are often seen within adenomas (so-called 
endocrine  atypia ) and must not be taken as a sign of 
malignancy. Mitotic figures are rare. In contrast with the normal parathyroid parenchyma, adipose tissue is inconspicu -
ous within adenomas.

Parathyroid  hyperplasia  is typically  a multiglandu -
lar process. In some cases, however, enlargement may be 
grossly apparent in only one or two glands, complicating the distinction between hyperplasia and adenoma. The combined weight of all glands rarely exceeds 1.0 g and often is less. Microscopically, the most common pattern seen is that of chief cell hyperplasia, which may involve the glands in a diffuse or multinodular pattern.

Less commonly, the constitu -
ent cells contain abundant clear cytoplasm as a consequence of accumulation of glycogen—a condition designated “water-clear cell hyperplasia.” As in the case of adenomas, stromal fat is inconspicuous within foci of hyperplasia. Parathyroid  carcinomas may be circumscribed lesions 
that are difficult to distinguish from adenomas, or they may be clearly invasive neoplasms.

These tumors enlarge one parathyroid gland and consist of gray-white, irregular masses that sometimes exceed 10 g in weight. The cells usually are uniform and resemble normal parathyroid cells. They are arrayed in nodular or trabecular patterns with a dense, fibrous capsule enclosing the mass. There is general agree -
ment that a 
diagnosis  of carcinoma  based  on cytologic  
detail  is unreliable,  and invasion  of surrounding  
tissues  and metastasis  are the only definitive

737 Hyperparathyroidism
Clinical Features
Primary hyperparathyroidism usually is a disease of adults 
and is much more common in women than in men (gender ratio of nearly 4:1). The most common manifestation of primary 
hyperparathyroidism is an increase in serum ionized calcium. In 
fact, primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of clinically silent hypercalcemia. Of note, other condi -
tions also may produce hypercalcemia ( Table 19–4).

The 
most common cause of clinically apparent hypercalcemia in adults is paraneoplastic syndromes associated with malignancy and bone metastases ( Chapter 5). The prognosis 
for patients with malignancy-associated hypercalcemia is poor, because it often occurs in those with advanced cancers.

In persons with hypercalcemia caused by parathy -
roid hyperfunction, serum PTH is inappropriately elevated, whereas serum PTH is low to undetectable in those with hypercalcemia caused by nonparathyroid diseases, includ -
ing malignancy. Other laboratory alterations referable to PTH excess include hypophosphatemia and increased urinary excretion of both calcium and phosphate.criteria. Local recurrence occurs in one third of cases, and more distant dissemination occurs in another third.

Morphologic  changes  in other  organs deserving 
special mention are found in the skeleton and kidneys. Skel-
etal changes include increased osteoclastic activity, which 
results in erosion of bone matrix and mobilization of calcium salts, particularly in the metaphyses of long tubular bones. Bone resorption is accompanied by increased osteoblastic activity and the formation of new bone trabeculae.

In more severe cases the cortex is grossly thinned and the marrow contains increased amounts of fibrous tissue accompanied by foci of hemorrhage and cysts 
(osteitis  fibrosa  cystica) 
(Chapter 20). Aggregates of osteoclasts, reactive giant cells, and hemorrhagic debris occasionally form masses that may be mistaken for neoplasms (
brown  tumors of hyperpara -
thyroidism).

PTH-induced hypercalcemia favors the forma -
tion of urinary tract stones (nephrolithiasis) as well as calcification of the renal interstitium and tubules (nephrocal -
cinosis). Metastatic calcification secondary to hypercalcemia also may be seen in other sites, including the stomach, lungs, myocardium, and blood vessels. A

Malignancy is the most common cause of symptomatic hypercalcemia. Primary hyper -
parathyroidism and malignancy together account for nearly 90% of cases of hypercalcemia.†Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism are most commonly associated with progressive renal failure.

Primary hyperparathyroidism traditionally has been 
associated with a constellation of symptoms that included 
“painful bones, renal stones, abdominal groans, and psychic moans.” Pain, secondary to fractures of bones weakened by osteoporosis or osteitis fibrosa cystica and resulting from renal stones, with obstructive uropathy, was at one time a prominent manifestation of primary hyper -
parathyroidism.

Because serum calcium is now routinely assessed in the workup of most patients who need blood tests for unrelated conditions, clinically silent hyperpara -
thyroidism is detected early. Hence, many of the classic clinical manifestations, particularly those referable to bone and renal disease, are seen much less frequently.

Addi -
tional signs and symptoms that may be encountered in some cases include
- Gastrointestinal disturbances, including constipation, nausea, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, and gallstones
- Central nervous system alterations, including depression, 
lethargy, and seizures
- Neuromuscular abnormalities, including weakness and 
hypotonia
- Polyuria and secondary polydipsia
Although some of these alterations, for example, polyuria and muscle weakness, are clearly related to hypercalcemia,

Clinical Features
The clinical manifestations of secondary hyperparathy-
roidism usually are dominated by those related to chronic renal failure. Bone abnormalities ( renal osteodystrophy) and 
other changes associated with PTH excess are, in general, less severe than those seen in primary hyperparathyroid -
ism. Serum calcium remains near normal because the com-pensatory increase in PTH levels sustains serum calcium.

The metastatic calcification of blood vessels (secondary to hyperphosphatemia) occasionally may result in significant ischemic damage to skin and other organs—a process sometimes referred to as calciphylaxis. In a minority of 
patients, parathyroid activity may become autonomous and excessive, with resultant hypercalcemia—a process sometimes termed tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Para -
thyroidectomy may be necessary to control the hyperpara -
thyroidism in such patients.

SUMMARY
Hyperparathyroidism
- Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause 
of asymptomatic hypercalcemia. MORPHOLOGY
The parathyr oid glands  in secondary  hyperparath y-
roidism  are hyperplastic . As in the case of primary 
hyperplasia, the degree of glandular enlargement is not nec-essarily symmetric.

On microscopic examination, the hyper -
plastic glands contain an increased number of chief cells, or cells with more abundant, clear cytoplasm (water-
clear  
cells), in a diffuse or multinodular distribution. Fat cells are decreased in number. Bone  changes similar to those seen 
in primary hyperparathyroidism also may be present. Meta-
static  calcification may be seen in many tissues. the pathogenesis of many of the other manifestations of the disorder remains poorly understood.

Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by any condi -
tion associated with a chronic depression in the serum calcium level, because low serum calcium leads to compen -
satory overactivity of the parathyroids. Renal failure is by 
far the most common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. The mechanisms by which chronic renal failure induces secondary hyperparathyroidism are complex and not fully understood.

Chronic renal insufficiency is associated with decreased phosphate excretion, which in turn results in hyperphosphatemia. The elevated serum phosphate levels directly depress serum calcium levels and thereby stimu -
late parathyroid gland activity.

In addition, loss of renal substances reduces the availability of α
1-hydroxylase 
enzyme necessary for the synthesis of the active form of vitamin D, which in turn reduces intestinal absorption of calcium (Chapter 7).• In a majority of cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is 
caused by a sporadic parathyroid adenoma and, less com ­
monly, by parathyroid hyperplasia. - Parathyroid adenomas are solitary, while hyperplasia typi ­
cally is a multiglandular process.

- Skeletal manifestations of hyperparathyroidism include 
bone resorption, osteitis fibrosa cystica, and brown tumors. Renal changes include nephrolithiasis (stones) and nephrocalcinosis. - The clinical manifestations of hyperparathyroidism can be 
summarized as “painful bones, renal stones, abdominal groans, and psychic moans.”
- Secondary hyperparathyroidism most often is caused by 
renal failure, and the parathyroid glands are hyperplastic.

- Malignancies ar e the most important cause of symptom ­
atic hypercalcemia, which results from osteolytic metasta ­
ses or release of PTH ­related protein from nonparathyroid 
tumors. HYPOPARATHYROIDISM
Hypoparathyroidism is far less common than hyperpara -
thyroidism. The major causes of hypoparathyroidism include the following:
- Surgically induced hypoparathyroidism: The most common cause is inadvertent removal of parathyroids during thyroidectomy or other surgical neck dissections.

- Congenital absence: This occurs in conjunction with thymic aplasia (Di George syndrome) and cardiac defects, secondary to deletions on chromosome 22q11.2 (Chapter 6)
- Autoimmune hypoparathyroidism: This is a hereditary polyglandular deficiency syndrome arising from auto-antibodies to multiple endocrine organs (parathyroid, thyroid, adrenals, and pancreas).

Chronic fungal infec-tions involving the skin and mucous membranes (muco -
cutaneous candidiasis) are sometimes encountered in affected persons. This condition is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator gene ( AIRE) and is discussed 
more extensively later on, in the context of autoimmune adrenalitis.

As one consequence of the failure of self-tolerance, some of these patients make autoantibodies against their own IL-17, accounting for the increased susceptibility to Candida infections (in which the T
H17 
response plays an important protective role).

The major clinical manifestations of hypoparathyroidism are secondary to hypocalcemia and include increased neu-
romuscular irritability (tingling, muscle spasms, facial grimac -
ing, and sustained carpopedal spasm or tetany), cardiac 
arrhythmias, and, on occasion, increased intracranial pres-
sures and seizures. Morphologic changes generally are 
inconspicuous but may include cataracts, calcification of the cerebral basal ganglia, and dental abnormalities.

739 Diabetes Mellitus
ENDOCRINE  PANCREAS
The endocrine pancreas consists of about 1 million micro-
scopic clusters of cells, the islets of Langerhans, which contain four major cell types—beta, alpha, delta, and PP (pancreatic polypeptide) cells. The cells can be differenti -
ated morphologically by their staining properties, by the ultrastructural characteristics of their granules, and by their hormone content.

The beta cell produces insulin, which 
is the most potent anabolic hormone known, with multiple synthetic and growth-promoting effects; the alpha cell 
secretes glucagon, inducing hyperglycemia by its glycogeno-lytic activity in the liver; delta cells contain somatostatin, 
which suppresses both insulin and glucagon release; and PP cells contain a unique pancreatic polypeptide, VIP, that 
exerts several gastrointestinal effects, such as stimulation of secretion of gastric and intestinal enzymes and inhibi -
tion of intestinal motility.

The most important disease of the endocrine pancreas is diabetes mellitus, caused by defi -
cient production or action of insulin. DIABETES MELLITUS
Diabetes mellitus is not a single disease entity but rather a group of metabolic disorders sharing the common underlying feature of hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia in diabetes results from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or, most commonly, both.

The chronic hyperglycemia and attendant metabolic deregulation of diabetes mellitus may be associ -
ated with secondary damage in multiple organ systems, especially the kidneys, eyes, nerves, and blood vessels. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes affects over 20 million children and adults, or 7% of the population, in the United States, nearly a third of whom are currently unaware that they have hyperglycemia.

Approximately 1.5 million new cases of diabetes are diag -
nosed each year in the United States, and diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease, adult-onset blind-ness, and nontraumatic lower extremity amputations.

A staggering 54 million adults in this country have prediabe-
tes, which is defined as elevated blood sugar that does not reach the criterion accepted for an outright diagnosis of diabetes (discussed next); persons with prediabetes have an elevated risk for development of frank diabetes. Diagnosis
Blood glucose levels normally are maintained in a very narrow range, usually 70 to 120 mg/d L. The diagnosis of diabetes is established by elevation of blood glucose by any one of three criteria:
1.

A random blood glucose concentration of 200 mg/d L or 
higher, with classical signs and symptoms (discussed next)
2. A fasting glucose concentration of 126 mg/d L or higher 
on more than one occasion
3. An abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), in 
which the glucose concentration is 200 mg/d L or higher 2 hours after a standard carbohydrate load (75 g of glucose). Derangements in carbohydrate metabolism proceed along a continuum.

Persons with serum fasting glucose values less than 110 mg/d L, or less than 140 mg/d L for an OGTT, are considered to be euglycemic. However, those with serum fasting glucose greater than 110 but less than 126 mg/d L, or OGTT values of greater than 140 but less than 200 mg/d L, are considered to have impaired glucose toler -
ance, also known as prediabetes.

Persons with impaired 
glucose tolerance have a significant risk for progression to overt diabetes over time, with as many as 5% to 10% advancing to full-fledged diabetes mellitus per year. In addition, those with impaired glucose tolerance are at risk 
for cardiovascular disease, as a consequence of abnormal car -
bohydrate metabolism and the coexistence of other risk factors (Chapter 9).

Classification
Although all forms of diabetes mellitus share hyperglyce -
mia as a common feature, the underlying causes of hyper -
glycemia vary widely. The vast majority of cases of diabetes 
fall into one of two broad classes:
- Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion caused by pancreatic beta cell destruction, usually resulting from an autoimmune attack. Type 1 diabetes accounts for approximately 10% of all cases.

- Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is caused by a combination of peripheral resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory response of insulin secretion by the pan-creatic beta cells ( relative insulin deficiency ). Approxi-
mately 80% to 90% of patients have type 2 diabetes. A variety of monogenic and secondary causes make up the remaining cases of diabetes ( Table 19–5).

An important 
point is that although the major types of diabetes arise by different pathogenic mechanisms, the long-term complica -
tions in kidneys, eyes, nerves, and blood vessels are the same and are the principal causes of morbidity and death. Normal Insulin Physiology and 
Glucose Homeostasis
Before discussing the pathogenesis of the two major types of diabetes, we briefly review normal insulin physiology and glucose metabolism.

Normal glucose homeostasis is 
tightly regulated by three interrelated processes: (1) glucose production in the liver, (2) glucose uptake and utilization by peripheral tissues, chiefly skeletal muscle, and (3) actions of insulin and counterregulatory hormones 
(e.g., glucagon). The principal metabolic function of insulin is to increase the 
rate of glucose transport into certain cells in the body (Fig. 19–21).

These are the striated muscle cells (including myocar -
dial cells) and, to a lesser extent, adipocytes, representing 
collectively about two thirds of total body weight. Glucose uptake in other peripheral tissues, most notably the brain, is insulin-independent. In muscle cells, glucose is then

either stored as glycogen or oxidized to generate adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP). In adipose tissue, glucose is stored primarily as lipid. Besides promoting lipid synthesis (lipo -
genesis), insulin also inhibits lipid degradation (lipolysis) in adipocytes.

Similarly, insulin promotes amino acid uptake and protein synthesis while inhibiting protein deg -
radation. Thus, the metabolic effects of insulin can be summa -
rized as anabolic, with increased synthesis and reduced degradation of glycogen, lipid, and protein. In addition to these 
metabolic effects, insulin has several mitogenic functions, 
including initiation of DNA synthesis in certain cells and stimulation of their growth and differentiation.

Insulin reduces the production of glucose from the liver. Insulin and glucagon have opposing regulatory effects on glucose homeostasis. During fasting states, low insulin and 
high glucagon levels facilitate hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (glycogen breakdown) while decreasing glycogen synthesis, thereby preventing hypoglycemia. Thus, fasting plasma glucose levels are determined primar -
ily by hepatic glucose output.

After a meal, insulin levels rise and glucagon levels fall in response to the large glucose load. The most important stimulus that triggers insulin release 
is glucose itself, which initiates insulin synthesis in the pancre -
atic beta cells.

In peripheral tissues (skeletal muscle and adipose tissue), secreted insulin binds to the insulin recep-
tor, triggering a number of intracellular responses that promote glucose uptake and postprandial glucose utiliza -
tion, thereby maintaining glucose homeostasis. Abnormali -
ties at various points along this complex signaling cascade, from synthesis and release of insulin by beta cells to insulin receptor interactions in peripheral tissues, can result in the diabetic phenotype.

PATHOGENESIS
T ype 1 Diabetes Mellitus
T ype  1 diabetes  is an autoimmune  disease  in which  
islet destruction  is caused  primarily  by immune  
effector  cells reacting  against  endogenous  beta cell 
antigens. Type 1 diabetes most commonly develops in child -
hood, becomes manifest at puberty, and progresses with age.

Most patients with type 1 diabetes depend on exogenous insulin for survival; without insulin they develop serious meta-bolic complications such as ketoacidosis and coma. Although the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes is abrupt, this 
disease in fact results from a chronic autoimmune attack on beta cells that usually starts many years before the disease becomes evident (Fig. 19–22).

The classic manifestations of the disease (hyperglycemia and ketosis) occur late in its course, after more than 90% of the beta cells have been destroyed. The fundamental  immune  abnormality  in 
type 1 diabetes  is a failure  of self-tolerance  in T cells.

This failure of tolerance may be a result of some combination of defective clonal deletion of self-reactive T cells in the thymus, as well as defects in the functions of regulatory T cells or resistance of effector T cells to suppression by regula -
tory cells. Thus, autoreactive T cells not only survive but are poised to respond to self-antigens.

Not surprisingly, autoan-
tibodies against a variety of beta cell antigens, including insulin and the beta cell enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase, are detected in the blood of 70% to 80% of patients. In the rare cases in which the pancreatic lesions have been exam-ined early in the disease process, the islets show necrosis of beta cells and lymphocytic infiltration (so-called insulitis).

As with most autoimmune diseases, the pathogenesis of 
type 1 diabetes involves the interplay of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (Chapter 6) have identified over 20 susceptibility loci for type 1 diabetes. Of these, 
the principal  susceptibility  locus  
for type 1 diabetes  resides  in the chromosomal  
region  that encodes  the class II MHC  molecules  on 
6p21 (HLA-D).

Between 90% and 95% of white patients with type 1 diabetes have HLA-DR3, or DR4, or both, in 
contrast with about 40% of normal subjects, and 40% to 50% of patients are DR3/DR4 heterozygotes, in contrast with 5% 
of normal subjects. Of note, despite the high relative risk in persons with particular class II alleles, most people who inherit these alleles do not develop diabetes.

Several non-HLA 
genes also confer susceptibility to type 1 diabetes, including polymorphisms within the gene encoding insulin itself, as well as CTLA4 and PTPN22. CTLA-4 is an inhibitory receptor of 
T cells and PTPN-22 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase; both are thought to inhibit T cell responses, so polymorphisms that interfere with their functional activity are expected to set the stage for excessive T cell activation.

Polymorphisms in the insulin gene may reduce expression of this protein in the thymus, thus reducing the elimination of T cells reactive with this self protein ( Chapter 4). Additional evidence suggests 
that 
environmental  factors, especially infections, may be 
involved in type 1 diabetes.

It has been proposed that certain viruses (mumps, rubella, and coxsackie B viruses, in particu -
lar) may be an initiating trigger, perhaps because some viral antigens are antigenically similar to beta cell antigens (molec-
ular mimicry), leading to bystander damage to the islets, 
but this idea is not conclusively established. T ype 2 Diabetes Mellitus
Type 2 diabetes is a prototypical complex multifactorial disease.

Environmental factors, such as a sedentary life style and dietary habits, unequivocally play a role, as described in the subsequent discussion of the association with obesity. Genetic factors are also involved in the pathogenesis, as evidenced by the disease concordance rate of 35% to 60% in monozygotic twins compared with nearly half that in dizy -
gotic twins. Such concordance is even greater than in type 1 diabetes, suggesting perhaps an even larger genetic compo -
nent in type 2 diabetes.

Additional  evidence  for a genetic  
basis  has emerged  from  recent  large-scale  genome-
wide  association  studies,  which  have identified  more  
than a dozen  susceptibility  loci called  “diabetogenic”  
genes. Unlike type 1 diabetes, however, the disease is not linked to genes involved in immune tolerance and regulation (e.g., HLA, CTLA4), and evidence of an autoimmune basis is 
lacking.

The two metabolic defects that characterize type 2 diabetes are (1) a decreased ability of peripheral tissues to respond to insulin (insulin resistance) and (2) beta cell dys -
function that is manifested as inadequate insulin secretion in the face of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia ( Fig. 19–23).

Insulin resistance predates the development of hyperglyce-mia and usually is accompanied by compensatory beta cell hyperfunction and hyperinsulinemia in the early stages of the evolution of diabetes.(?) Precipitating event

Insulin resistance is defined as the failure of target tissues to 
respond normally to insulin. It leads to decreased uptake of glucose in muscle, reduced glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation in the liver, and an inability to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis.

A variety of functional defects have been

leading to insulin resistance has increased substantially 
(Fig. 19–24):
- Role of excess free fatty acids (FFAs): Cross-sectional 
studies have demonstrated an inverse correlation between fasting plasma FFAs and insulin sensitivity. The level of intracellular triglycerides often is markedly increased in muscle and liver tissues in obese persons, presumably because excess circulating FFAs are depos -
ited in these organs.

Intracellular triglycerides and prod -
ucts of fatty acid metabolism are potent inhibitors of insulin signaling and result in an acquired insulin resis -
tance state. These lipotoxic effects of FFAs are mediated 
through a decrease in activity of key insulin-signaling proteins. - Role of inflammation : Over the past several years, inflam -
mation has emerged as a major player in the pathogen -
esis of type 2 diabetes.

It is now known that a permissive inflammatory milieu (mediated not by an autoimmune 
process as in type 1 diabetes but rather by pro-inflammatory cytokines that are secreted in response to excess nutrients such as FFAs) results in both peripheral insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction (see later). Excess FFAs within macrophages and beta cells can engage the inflammasome, a multiprotein cytoplasmic 
complex that leads to secretion of the cytokine interleu-kin IL-1β (Chapter 2).

IL-1β, in turn, mediates the Figure  19–24 Mechanisms of beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance 
in type 2 diabetes. Free fatty acids directly cause beta cell dysfunction and 
induce insulin resistance in target tissues (such as striated muscle, shown 
here), and also induce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that cause more beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance.

reported in the insulin signaling pathway in states of 
insulin resistance (for example, reduced phosphorylation-dependent activation of the insulin receptor and its down -
stream components), which attenuate signal transduction. Few factors play as important a role in the development of insulin resistance as obesity. Obesity and Insulin Resistance
The association of obesity with type 2 diabetes has been recognized for decades, with visceral obesity being common in a majority of affected patients.

Insulin resistance is present even with simple obesity unaccompanied by hyperglycemia, indicating a fundamental abnormality of insulin signaling in states of fatty excess. In fact, the term metabolic syndrome has been applied to a constellation of findings dominated by visceral obesity, which is accompa -
nied by insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and cardio -
vascular risk factors such as hypertension and abnormal lipid profiles (Chapter 7).

In the absence of weight loss and lifestyle modifications, persons with metabolic syn -
drome are at significant risk for the development of frank type 2 diabetes, underscoring the importance of obesity to the pathogenesis of this disease. The risk of diabetes increases as the body mass index (a measure of body fat content) increases, suggesting a dose-response relationship between body fat and insulin resistance.

Although many details of the so-called adipo-insulin axis remain to be eluci -
dated, recognition of some of the putative pathways

Monogenic Forms of Diabetes
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are genetically complex, and 
despite the associations with multiple susceptibility loci, no single-gene defect (mutation) can account for predisposi -
tion to these entities. By contrast, monogenic forms of dia -
betes (Table 19–5) are uncommon examples of the diabetic 
phenotype occurring as a result of loss-of-function mutations within a single gene.

Monogenic causes of diabetes include 
either a primary defect in beta cell function or a defect in insulin receptor signaling. The largest subgroup of patients in this category traditionally was designated as having maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) because of its 
superficial resemblance to type 2 diabetes and its occur -
rence in younger patients; MODY can be the result of inac -
tivating mutations in one of six genes.

Other uncommon causes include maternally inherited diabetes and bilateral deaf -
ness, secondary to mitochondrial DNA mutations, and mutations within the insulin gene itself, which most com -
monly manifests with diabetes in the neonatal period. Finally, rare instances of insulin receptor mutations that 
affect receptor synthesis, insulin binding, or downstream signal transduction can cause severe insulin resistance, accompanied by hyperinsulinemia and diabetes.

Complications of Diabetes
Diabetes can be a devastating disease because the abnor -
mal glucose metabolism and other metabolic derange -
ments have serious pathologic effects on virtually all the systems of the body. The most significant complications of diabetes are vascular abnormalities, renal damage, and lesions affecting the peripheral nerves and eyes ( Fig. 19–25). The pathologic findings in these tissues and their clinical consequences are described below.

There is extreme variability among patients in the time of onset of these complications, their severity, and the particular organ or organs involved. In persons with tight control of their dia -
betes, the onset may be delayed. The pathogenesis of the long-term complications of diabetes is 
multifactorial, although persistent hyperglycemia (glucotoxicity) seems to be a key mediator.

At least three distinct metabolic pathways seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of long-term complications; it is likely that all of them play a role in a tissue-specific manner. 1. Formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs are formed as a result of nonenzymatic reactions between intracellular glucose-derived precursors (glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and 3-deoxyglucosone) with the amino groups of both intracellular and extracellular proteins.

The natural rate of AGE formation is greatly accelerated in the presence of hyperglycemia. AGEs bind to a specific receptor (RAGE), which is expressed on inflammatory cells (macrophages and T cells) and in endothelium and vascular smooth muscle.

The detri -
mental effects of the AGE-RAGE signaling axis within the vascular compartment include
- Release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth 
factors from intimal macrophages
- Generation of reactive oxygen species in endothelial 
cellssecretion of additional pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages, islets, and other cells that are released into the circulation and act on the major sites of insulin action to promote insulin resistance.

Thus, excess FFAs can impede insulin signaling directly within peripheral tissues, as well as indirectly through the release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines. Not sur prisingly, there are now 
several ongoing trials of cytokine antagonists (particu-larly of IL-1β) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

- Role of adipokines : Adipose tissue is not merely a passive 
storage depot for fat; it can operate as a functional endo-crine organ, releasing so-called adipokines in response to 
extracellular stimuli or changes in metabolic status. Thus, adipocytes also release IL-1 β and other pro-
inflammatory cytokines into the circulation in response to excess FFAs, which promote peripheral insulin resis -
tance.

By contrast, adiponectin is an adipokine with 
insulin sensitizing activity, which probably acts by dampening the inflammatory response. - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor -γ (PPARγ): 
PPARγ is a nuclear receptor and transcription factor expressed in adipose tissue and plays a seminal role in adipocyte differentiation. A class of antidiabetic medica -
tions known as thiazolidinediones acts as agonist ligands for PPARγ and improves insulin sensitivity.

Activation of PPARγ promotes secretion of antihyperglycemic adipokines such as adiponectin, and shifts the deposi -
tion of FFAs toward adipose tissue and away from liver and skeletal muscle. Beta Cell Dysfunction
Beta cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes reflects the inability of these cells to adapt themselves to the long-term demands of peripheral insulin resistance and increased insulin secre -
tion.

In states of insulin resistance, insulin secretion ini -
tially is higher for each level of glucose than in controls. This hyperinsulinemic state is a compensation for periph-eral resistance and often can maintain normal plasma glucose for years. Eventually, however, beta cell compen -
sation becomes inadequate, and there is progression to hyperglycemia, which is accompanied by an absolute loss in beta cell mass.

The molecular mechanisms underlying beta cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes are multifactorial and in many instances overlap with those implicated in insulin resistance. Thus, excess nutrients such as FFAs and glucose can promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from beta cells, which leads to recruitment of mononuclear cells (macrophages and T cells) into the islets, resulting in more local cytokine production.

The conse -
quences of this abnormal inflammatory microenvironment are beta cell dysfunction and, ultimately, beta cell death. Amyloid replacement of islets is a characteristic finding in persons with long-standing type 2 diabetes and is present 
in more than 90% of diabetic islets examined (see later). The islet amyloid polypetide (IAPP), also known as amylin, is secreted by the beta cells in conjunction with insulin, and its abnormal aggregation results in amyloid.

IAPP also engages the inflammasome and promotes IL-1 β secretion, 
thus sustaining the inflammatory onslaught on surviving beta cells even late in the disease.

MORPHOLOGY
Diabetes and Its Late Complications 
Pathologic findings in the diabetic pancreas are variable and 
not necessarily dramatic. The important morphologic changes are related to the many late systemic complications of dia -
betes.

In most patients, morphologic changes are likely to be found in arteries 
(macrovascular  disease), basement 
membranes of small vessels (microangiopathy), kidneys 
(diabetic  nephropathy), retina (retinopathy), nerves 
(neuropathy), and other tissues. These changes are seen in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (Fig. 19–25). Pancreas. Lesions in the pancreas are inconstant and rarely 
of diagnostic value.

One or more of the following alterations may be present:
- Reduction  in the number  and size of islets. This 
change most often is seen in type 1 diabetes, particularly with rapidly advancing disease. Most of the islets are small, inconspicuous, and not easily detected. - Leukocytic  infiltration  of the islets, which are prin -
cipally composed of mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and macrophages) (Fig. 19–26, A).

Of note, both type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes may demonstrate islet inflammation early in the disease, although it is typically more severe in T1D. In both types inflammation is often absent by the time the disease is clinically evident. - Amyloid  replacement  of islets  in long-standing  
type 2 diabetes, appearing as deposition of pink, amor-
phous material beginning in and around capillaries and between cells. At advanced stages the islets may be virtu-ally obliterated (Fig.

19–26, B); fibrosis also may be 
observed. While inflammation is observed early in the natural history of type 2 diabetes, amyloid deposition occurs in long-standing cases. - An increase  in the number  and size of islets,  espe-
cially  characteristic  of nondiabetic  newborns  of 
diabetic  mothers. Presumably, fetal islets undergo 
hyperplasia in response to the maternal hyperglycemia. Diabetic  Macrovascular  Disease. Diabetes exacts a 
heavy toll on the vascular system.

The hallmark of diabetic macrovascular disease is accelerated atherosclerosis affecting the aorta and large and medium-sized arteries. Except for its greater severity and earlier age at onset, atherosclerosis 
in diabetics is indistinguishable from that in nondiabetics (Chapter 9). Myocardial infarction, caused by atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, is the most common cause of death in diabetics. Significantly, it is almost as common in diabetic women as in diabetic men.

By contrast, myocardial infarction is uncommon in nondiabetic women of reproductive age. Gangrene of the lower extremities, as a result of advanced vascular disease, is about 100 times more common in persons with diabetes than in the general population. The larger renal arteries also are subject to severe atherosclerosis, but the most damaging effect of diabetes on the kidneys is exerted at the level of the glomeruli and the microcirculation, as discussed later on.

Hyaline  arteriolosclerosis, the vascular lesion associ -
ated with hypertension (Chapters 9 and 13), is both more prevalent and more severe in diabetics than in nondiabetics, but it is not specific for diabetes and may be seen in elderly persons who do not suffer from either diabetes or hyperten -
sion. It takes the form of an amorphous, hyaline thickening of the wall of the arterioles, which causes narrowing of the lumen (Fig. 19–27).

Not surprisingly, in diabetic patients, its severity is related not only to the duration of the disease but also to the presence or absence of hypertension. Diabetic  Microangiopathy. One of the most consistent 
morphologic features of diabetes is diffuse  thickening  of 
basement  membranes. The thickening is most evident in 
the capillaries of the skin, skeletal muscle, retina, renal glo -
meruli, and renal medulla.

However, it also may be seen in such nonvascular structures as renal tubules, the Bowman • Increased procoagulant activity on endothelial cells and 
macrophages
- Enhanced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells 
and synthesis of extracellular matrix
In addition to receptor-mediated effects, AGEs can 
directly cross-link extracellular matrix proteins, which 
decreases protein removal while enhancing protein deposition.

AGEs cross-linked proteins can trap other 
plasma or interstitial proteins; for example, low-den-sity lipoprotein (LDL) gets trapped within AGE-mod-ified large vessel walls, accelerating atherosclerosis (Chapter 9), while albumin can get trapped within capillaries, accounting in part for the basement mem -
brane thickening that is characteristic of diabetic microangiopathy (see later). 2. Activation of protein kinase C.

Activation of intracellular 
protein kinase C (PKC) by calcium ions and the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) is an important signal transduction pathway in many cellular systems. Intra-cellular hyperglycemia can stimulate the de novo syn -
thesis of DAG from glycolytic intermediates and hence cause activation of PKC.

The downstream effects of PKC activation are numerous and include production of pro-
angiogenic molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), implicated in the neovascularization seen in diabetic retinopathy, and profibrogenic molecules such as transforming growth factor- β, leading to 
increased deposition of extracellular matrix and base -
ment membrane material. 3. Disturbances in polyol pathways.

In some tissues that do 
not require insulin for glucose transport (e.g., nerves, lens, kidneys, blood vessels), hyperglycemia leads to an increase in intracellular glucose that is then metabolized by the enzyme aldose reductase to sorbitol, a polyol, 
and eventually to fructose, in a reaction that uses NADPH (the reduced form of nicotinamide dinucleo -
tide phosphate) as a cofactor.

NADPH is also required by the enzyme glutathione reductase in a reaction that regenerates reduced glutathione (GSH). As described in Chapter 1, GSH is one of the important antioxidant mechanisms in the cell, and any reduction in GSH increases cellular susceptibility to oxidative stress. In 
neurons, persistent hyperglycemia appears to be the major underlying cause of diabetic neuropathy ( glucose 
neurotoxicity).

neuropathy. An indistinguishable microangiopathy can be 
found in aged nondiabetic patients, but rarely to the extent seen in persons with long-standing diabetes. Diabetic  Nephropathy. The kidneys are prime targets 
of diabetes (see also Chapter 13). Renal failure is second only 
to myocardial infarction as a cause of death from this disease.

Three lesions are encountered: (1) glomerular lesions; 
(2) renal vascular lesions, principally arteriolosclerosis; and (3) pyelonephritis, including necrotizing papillitis. The most important glomerular lesions are capillary base -
ment membrane thickening, diffuse mesangial sclerosis, and nodular glomerulosclerosis. The glomerular capillary base-ment membranes are thickened along their entire length.

This change can be detected by electron microscopy within a few years of the onset of diabetes, sometimes without any asso -
ciated change in renal function (Fig. 19–29). Diffuse  mesangial  sclerosis consists of a diffuse increase 
in mesangial matrix along with mesangial cell proliferation and

is found in most individuals with disease of more than 10 years’ duration.

When glomerulosclerosis becomes marked, patients manifest the nephrotic syndrome, characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema (Chapter 13). Nodular  glomerulosclerosis describes a glomerular 
lesion made distinctive by ball-like deposits of a laminated matrix situated in the periphery of the glomerulus (Fig. 19–30). These nodules are PAS-positive and usually contain trapped mesangial cells.

This distinctive change has been called the

pathologists who first described it. Nodular glomerulosclero -
sis is encountered in approximately 15% to 30% of persons with long-term diabetes and is a major contributor to

morbidity and mortality. Diffuse mesangial sclerosis also may 
be seen in association with old age and hypertension; by contrast, the nodular form of glomerulosclerosis, once certain unusual forms of nephropathies have been excluded (Chapter 13), is essentially pathognomonic of diabetes. Both the diffuse and the nodular forms of glomerulosclerosis induce sufficient ischemia to cause scarring of the kidneys, manifested by a finely granular-appearing cortical surface 
(Fig.

19–31). Renal  atherosclerosis  and arteriolosclerosis  con-
stitute  part of the macrovascular  disease  seen in 
diabetics. The kidney is one of the most frequently and severely affected organs; however, the changes in the arteries and arterioles are similar to those found throughout the body. Hyaline  arteriolosclerosis  affects  not only the 
afferent  but also the efferent  arterioles. Such efferent 
arteriolosclerosis is rarely if ever encountered in persons who do not have diabetes.

Pyelonephritis  is an acute  or chronic  inflammation  
of the kidneys  that usually  begins  in the interstitial  
tissue  and then spreads  to involve  the tubules. Both 
the acute and chronic forms of this disease occur in nondia -
betics as well as in diabetics but are more common in persons with diabetes than in the general population; once affected, diabetics tend to have more severe involvement.

One special pattern of acute pyelonephritis, 
necrotizing  papillitis (or 
papillary necrosis), is much more prevalent in diabetics than in nondiabetics. Ocular  Complications  of Diabetes. Visual impair -
ment, sometimes even total blindness, is one of the more feared consequences of long-standing diabetes. The ocular  
involvement  may take the form  of retinopathy,  cata-
ract formation,  or glaucoma.

Retinopathy, the most common pattern, consists of a constellation of changes that together are considered by many ophthalmologists to be virtually diagnostic of the disease. The lesion  in the retina  
takes  two forms:  nonproliferativ e (background)  reti-
nopathy  and proliferative  retinopathy.

Nonproliferative  retinopathy includes intraretinal or 
preretinal hemorrhages, retinal exudates, microaneurysms, venous dilations, edema, and, most importantly, thickening of the retinal capillaries (microangiopathy). The retinal exudates can be either “soft” (microinfarcts) or “hard” (deposits of plasma proteins and lipids) ( Fig. 19–32). The microaneurysms 
are discrete saccular dilations of retinal choroidal capillaries that appear through the ophthalmoscope as small red dots.

Dilations tend to occur at focal points of weakening, resulting from loss of pericytes. Retinal edema presumably results from excessive capillary permeability. Underlying all of these changes is the microangiopathy, which is thought to lead to loss of capillary pericytes and hence to focal weakening of capillary structure. The so-called  proliferative  retinopathy  is a process  
of neovascularization  and fibrosis.

Clinical Features
It is difficult to discuss with brevity the diverse clinical 
presentations of diabetes mellitus. Only a few characteristic patterns are presented here.

In the initial 1 or 2 years after manifestation of overt type 1 diabetes (referred to as the 
“honeymoon period”), exogenous insulin requirements may be minimal to none because of residual ongoing endogenous insulin secretion, but thereafter the beta cell reserve is exhausted and insulin requirements increase 
dramatically.

Although beta cell destruction is a gradual process, the transition from impaired glucose tolerance to overt diabetes may be abrupt, heralded by an event associ -
ated with increased insulin requirements such as infection. The onset is marked by polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, and in severe cases, ketoacidosis, all resulting from meta -
bolic derangements (Fig. 19–33).

Since insulin is a major anabolic hormone in the body, 
deficiency of insulin results in a catabolic state that affects not only glucose metabolism but also fat and protein metabolism. The assimilation of glucose into muscle and adipose tissue is sharply diminished or abolished. Not only does storage of glycogen in liver and muscle cease, but also reserves are depleted by glycogenolysis. The resultant hyperglycemia exceeds the renal threshold for reabsorption, and glycos -
uria ensues.

The glycosuria induces an osmotic diuresis and, consequently, polyuria, causing a profound loss of 
water and electrolytes. The obligatory renal water loss combined with the hyperosmolarity resulting from the increased levels of glucose in the blood tends to deplete intracellular water, triggering the osmoreceptors of the thirst centers of the brain. This sequence of events gener -
ates intense thirst ( polydipsia).

With a deficiency of insulin, 
the scales swing from insulin-promoted anabolism to catabolism of proteins and fats. Proteolysis follows, and the gluconeogenic amino acids are removed by the liver and used as building blocks for glucose. The catabolism of pro -
teins and fats tends to induce a negative energy balance, which in turn leads to increasing appetite (polyphagia), thus completing the classic triad of diabetes: polyuria, polydipsia, 
and polyphagia.

Despite the increased appetite, catabolic 
effects prevail, resulting in weight loss and muscle weak -
ness. The combination of polyphagia and weight loss is paradoxical and should always point to the diagnostic pos -
sibility of diabetes.

In patients with type 1 diabetes, deviations from normal 
dietary intake, unusual physical activity, infection, or any other forms of stress may rapidly influence the treacher -
ously fragile metabolic balance, predisposing the affected person to diabetic ketoacidosis. The plasma glucose usually 
is in the range of 500 to 700 mg/d L as a result of absolute insulin deficiency and unopposed effects of counterregula -
tory hormones (epinephrine, glucagon).

The marked hyperglycemia causes an osmotic diuresis and dehydration characteristic of the ketoacidotic state. The second major effect is activation of the ketogenic machinery. Insulin impotence, and diabetic mononeuropathy, which may mani -
fest as sudden footdrop or wristdrop or isolated cranial nerve palsies.

The neurologic changes may be the result of micro -
angiopathy and increased permeability of the capillaries that supply the nerves, as well as direct axonal damage.deficiency leads to activation of lipoprotein lipase, with resultant excessive breakdown of adipose stores, giving rise to increased FFAs, which are oxidized by the liver to produce ketones.

Ketogenesis is an adaptive phenomenon 
in times of starvation, generating ketones as a source of energy for consumption by vital organs (e.g., brain). The rate at which ketones are formed may exceed the rate at which they can be used by peripheral tissues, leading to ketonemia and ketonuria. If the urinary excretion of ketones 
is compromised by dehydration, the accumulating ketones decrease blood p H, resulting in metabolic ketoacidosis.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus also may manifest with polyuria 
and polydipsia, but unlike in type 1 diabetes, patients often are older than 40 years and frequently are obese. Unfortu -
nately, with the increase in obesity and sedentary life style in Western society, type 2 diabetes is now seen in children and adolescents with increasing frequency. In some cases, medical attention is sought because of unexplained weak -
ness or weight loss.

Most frequently, however, the diagnosis is 
made after routine blood or urine testing in asymptomatic persons. In the decompensated state, patients with type 2 diabe -
tes may develop hyperosmolar nonketotic coma. This syn-
drome is engendered by severe dehydration resulting from sustained osmotic diuresis and urinary fluid loss due to chronic hyperglycemia.

Typically, the affected person is an elderly diabetic who is disabled by a stroke or an infection and is unable to maintain adequate water intake. The absence of ketoacidosis and its symptoms (nausea, vomit-ing, respiratory difficulties) delays recognition of the seri -
ousness of the situation until the onset of severe dehydration and coma. Table 19–6 summarizes some of the pertinent 
clinical, genetic, and histopathologic features that distin -
guish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

As previously discussed, it is the long-term effects of 
diabetes, more than the acute metabolic complications, which are responsible for the overwhelming preponder -
ance of morbidity and mortality attributable to this disease. In most instances, these complications appear approxi -
mately 15 to 20 years after the onset of hyperglycemia.

- In both forms of long-standing diabetes, cardiovascular 
events such as myocardial infarction, renal vascular insufficiency, and stroke (cerebrovascular accident) are the most common contributors to mortality. The impact of cardiovascular disease can be gauged by its involve -
ment in as many as 80% of deaths among persons with type 2 diabetes; in fact, diabetics have a 3 to 7.5 times greater incidence of death from cardiovascular causes than nondiabetic populations.

The hallmark of cardio -
vascular disease is accelerated atherosclerosis of the large and medium-sized arteries (i.e., macrovascular disease). The importance of obesity in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance has already been discussed, but it also is an independent risk factor for development of atherosclerosis. - Diabetic nephropathy is a leading cause of end-stage 
renal disease in the United States.

The earliest manifesta-tion of diabetic nephropathy is the appearance of small amounts of albumin in the urine (greater than 30 but less than 300 mg/day—i.e., microalbuminuria). Without specific interventions, approximately 80% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 20% to 40% of those with type

The progression from overt nephropathy to end-stage renal disease can be highly variable and is evidenced by a progressive drop in glomerular filtration rate. By 20 years after diagnosis, more than 75% of persons with type 1 diabetes and about 20% of those with type 2 diabetes with overt nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease, necessitating dialysis or renal transplantation.

SUMMARY
Diabetes Mellitus: Pathogenesis and Long ­T erm 
Complications
- T ype 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterized 
by progressive destruction of islet beta cells, leading to 
absolute insulin deficiency. Both autoreactive T cells and autoantibodies are involved. - T ype 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance and beta 
cell dysfunction, resulting in relative insulin deficiency. Autoimmunity is not involved.

- Obesity has an important relationship with insulin resis ­
tance (and hence type 2 diabetes), probably mediated by cytokines released from adipose tissues (adipocytokines). Other players in the adipo-insulin axis include FFAs (which 
may cause lipotoxicity) and the PPARγ receptor, which 
modulates adipocytokine levels.

- Monogenic f orms of diabetes are uncommon and are 
caused by single ­gene defects that result in primary beta 
cell dysfunction (e.g., glucokinase mutation) or lead to 
also have an increased propensity for glaucoma and 
cataract formation, both of which contribute to visual impairment in diabetes. - Diabetic neuropathy can elicit a variety of clinical syn -
dromes, afflicting the central nervous system, peripheral sensorimotor nerves, and autonomic nervous system.

The most frequent pattern of involvement is a distal symmetric polyneuropathy of the lower extremities that affects both motor and sensory function, particularly the latter (Chapter 21). Over time, the upper extremities may be involved as well, thus approximating a “glove and stocking” pattern of polyneuropathy.

Other forms include autonomic neuropathy, which produces distur -
bances in bowel and bladder function and sometimes sexual impotence, and diabetic mononeuropathy, which may manifest as sudden footdrop, wristdrop, or isolated cranial nerve palsies. - Diabetic patients are plagued by an enhanced suscepti -
bility to infections of the skin, as well as to tuberculosis, pneumonia, and pyelonephritis. Such infections cause about 5% of diabetes-related deaths.

In a person with diabetic neuropathy, a trivial infection in a toe may be the first event in a long succession of complications (gan -
grene, bacteremia, pneumonia) that may ultimately lead to death. Several large-scale prospective studies have convincingly demonstrated that the long-term complications, and the associated morbidity and mortality, from diabetes are attenuated by strict glycemic control.

For patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin replacement therapy is the main -
stay of treatment, while non-pharmacologic approaches such as dietary restrictions and exercise (which improves insulin sensitivity) are often the “first line of defense” for type 2 diabetes.

Most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require therapeutic intervention to reduce hyperglycemia, which can be achieved by administration of a number of agents that lower glucose levels through several distinct mechanisms of action. Glycemic control is assessed clinically by measuring the percentage of glyco -
sylated hemoglobin, also known as Hb A1C, which is formed by non-enzymatic addition of glucose moieties to hemoglobin in red cells.

Unlike blood glucose levels, Hb A1C is a measure of glycemic control over long periods of time (2 to 3 months) and is relatively unaffected by day-to-day variations. An Hb A1C below 7% is taken as evi -
dence of tight glycemic control, but patients with Hb A1C levels in this range also have an increased risk of 
potentially life-threatening episodes of therapy-related hypoglycemia, and “optimal” control of glucose levels in diabetic patients remains an unsettled area of clinical investigation.

751 Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
MORPHOLOGY
Insulinomas exhibit favorable biologic behavior, possibly 
because the vast majority are identified while they are small (less than 2 cm in diameter) and localized to the pancreas. Most are solitary lesions, although multifocal tumors or tumors ectopic to the pancreas may be encountered. Malig -
nancy in insulinomas, constituting less than 10% of cases, is diagnosed on the basis of local invasion or metastases.

On histologic examination, these benign tumors look remarkably like giant islets, with preservation of the regular cords of monotonous cells and their orientation to the vasculature. Not even malignant lesions present much evidence of 
anaplasia, and they may be deceptively encapsulated. Depo-
sition  of amyloid in the extracellular tissue is a character -
istic feature of many insulinomas ( Fig. 19–34, A).

Under 
the electron microscope, neoplastic beta cells, like their normal counterparts, display distinctive round granules ( Fig. 19–34, B). abnormalities of insulin–insulin receptor signaling (e.g., insulin receptor gene mutations). - The long ­term complications of diabetes are similar in 
both types and affect mainly blood vessels, and the kidneys, nerves and eyes.

The development of these complications is attributed to three underlying mechanisms: formation of AGEs, activation of PKC, and disturbances in polyol pathways leading to oxidative stress. PANCREATIC NEUROENDOCRINE 
TUMORS
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Pan NETs), also known as 
islet cell tumors, are rare in comparison with tumors of the 
exocrine pancreas, accounting for only 2% of all pancreatic neoplasms.

Pan NETs are most common in adults and may be single or multifocal; when they are malignant, the liver is the most common site of organ metastases. These tumors have a propensity to elaborate pancreatic hormones, but some are nonfunctional. The latter typically are larger lesions at diagnosis, since they come to clinical attention later in their natural history than functional Pan NETs, which often present with symptoms related to excessive hormone production.

All Pan NETs, with the exception of insulinomas (see later), are regarded as having malignant potential, and in fact, 65% to 80% of Pan NETs manifest with overtly malignant features of biologic aggressiveness, such as invasion into local tissues or distant metastases. The proliferative rate of Pan NETs (measured using either 
mitotic counts or nuclear labeling with the proliferation marker Ki-67) is one of the best correlates of outcome.

Genomic sequencing of sporadic Pan NETs has identified recurrent somatic alterations in three major genes or pathways:
- MEN1, which causes familial MEN syndrome, type 1 (see later), is also mutated in many sporadic neuroendo -
crine tumors
- Loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes 
such as PTEN and TSC2, which are negative regulators 
of the oncogenic mammalian TOR (m TOR) signaling pathway
- Inactivating mutations in two genes, ATRX and DAXX, 
which have multiple cellular functions.

Of note, nearly half of Pan NETs have a somatic mutation in either ATRX 
or DAXX, but not both, suggesting that the encoded 
proteins function in a critical but redundant pathway. Insulinomas
Beta cell tumors (insulinomas) are the most common type of Pan NET and may be responsible for the elaboration of sufficient insulin to induce clinically significant hypoglyce -
mia.

The characteristic clinical picture is dominated by attacks of hypoglycemia, which occur when plasma blood glucose levels fall below 50 mg/d L. The attacks consist principally of such central nervous system manifestations as confusion, stupor, and loss of consciousness. They are precipitated by fasting or exercise and are promptly relieved by feeding or parenteral administration of glucose. Most insulinomas are cured by surgical resection.

MORPHOLOGY
Gastrinomas may arise in the pancreas, the peripancreatic 
region, or the wall of the duodenum. Over  half of gastrin-
producing  tumors  are locally  invasive  or have already  
metastasized  at the time  of diagnosis.

In approximately 
25% of patients, gastrinomas arise in conjunction with other endocrine tumors, thus conforming to the MEN-1 syndrome (see further on); MEN-1–associated gastrinomas frequently are multifocal, while sporadic gastrinomas usually are single. As with insulin-secreting tumors of the pancreas, gastrin-producing tumors are histologically bland and rarely exhibit marked anaplasia.

ADRENAL  CORTEX
The adrenal glands are paired endocrine organs consisting 
of two regions, the cortex and medulla, which differ in their development, structure, and function. The cortex consists 
of three layers of distinct cell types. Beneath the capsule of the adrenal is the narrow layer of zona glomerulosa. An equally narrow zona reticularis abuts the medulla. Inter-vening is the broad zona fasciculata, which makes up about 75% of the total cortex.

The adrenal cortex synthesizes three different types of steroids:
- Glucocorticoids (principally cortisol), which are synthe -
sized primarily in the zona fasciculata, with a small con -
tribution from the zona reticularis
- Mineralocorticoids, the most important being aldosterone, which are generated in the zona glomerulosa
- Sex steroids (estrogens and androgens), which are pro -
duced largely in the zona reticularis
The adrenal medulla is composed of chromaffin cells, which 
synthesize and secrete catecholamines, mainly epinephrine.

This section deals first with disorders of the adrenal cortex and then of the medulla. Diseases of the adrenal cortex can be conveniently divided into those associated with cortical hyperfunction and those characterized by cortical hypofunction.

ADRENOCORTICAL 
HYPERFUNCTION (HYPERADRENALISM)
There are three distinctive hyperadrenal clinical syn-
dromes, each caused by abnormal production of one or more of the hormones produced by the three layers of the cortex: (1) Cushing syndrome, characterized by an excess of 
cortisol; (2) hyperaldosteronism; and (3) adrenogenital or 
viri-
lizing syndromes, caused by an excess of androgens.

The clinical features of some of these syndromes overlap some-what because of the overlapping functions of some of the adrenal steroids. Hypercortisolism and Cushing Syndrome
Hypercortisolism, typically manifested as Cushing syn-
drome, is caused by any condition that produces an eleva-tion in glucocorticoid levels. In clinical practice, the vast majority of cases of Cushing syndrome are the result of administration of exogenous glucocorticoids (iatrogenic).

The remaining cases are endogenous, and the three most common etiologic disorders are (Fig.

19–35):
- Primary hypothalamic-pituitary diseases associated 
with hypersecretion of ACTH
- The secretion of ectopic ACTH by non-pituitary 
neoplasms
- Primary adrenocortical neoplasms (adenoma or carci -
noma) and rarely, primary cortical hyperplasia
Primary hypothalamic-pituitary disease associated with hypersecretion of ACTH, also known as Cushing disease, 
accounts for approximately 70% of cases of spontaneous, endogenous Cushing syndrome.

The prevalence of this 
disorder is about four times higher among women than among men, and it occurs most frequently during young adulthood (the 20s and 30s). In the vast majority of cases, the pituitary gland contains an ACTH-producing microadenoma 
that does not produce mass effects in the brain; some cor-ticotroph tumors qualify as macroadenomas (larger than 10 mm across).

In the remaining patients, the anterior 
pituitary contains areas of corticotroph cell hyperplasia 
without a discrete adenoma. Corticotroph cell hyperplasia may be primary or, much less commonly, secondary to excessive ACTH release by a hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)–producing tumor.

The adrenal glands in patients with Cushing disease are characterized by a variable degree of bilateral nodular cortical hyperpla -
sia (discussed later), secondary to the elevated levels 
of ACTH (“ACTH-dependent” Cushing syndrome). The cortical hyperplasia is in turn responsible for the hypercortisolism. Secretion of ectopic ACTH by nonpituitary tumors 
accounts for about 10% of cases of Cushing syndrome.

In Gastrinomas
Marked hypersecretion of gastrin usually has its origin in gastrin-producing tumors (gastrinomas), which are just as likely to arise in the duodenum and peripancreatic soft tissues as in the pancreas (the so-called gastrinoma trian -
gle).

Zollinger and Ellison first called attention to the asso-
ciation of pancreatic islet cell lesions with hypersecretion of gastric acid and severe peptic ulceration, which are present in 90% to 95% of patients with gastrinomas—the clinical hall -
mark of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. In this condition, hypergastrinemia from a pancreatic or duodenal tumor stimulates extreme gastric acid secretion, which in turn causes peptic ulceration.

The duodenal and gastric ulcers 
often are multiple; although they are identical to those 
found in the general population, they often are unresponsive 
to usual therapy. In addition, ulcers may occur in unusual 
locations such as the jejunum; when intractable jejunal ulcers are found, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome should be considered. More than half of the affected patients have diarrhea; in 30%, it is the presenting manifestation.

## Page 767

753 Adrenocortical Hyperfunction (Hyperadrenalism)
many instances the responsible tumor is a small cell carci-
noma of the lung, although other neoplasms, including car-
cinoids, medullary carcinomas of the thyroid, and Pan NETs, have been associated with the syndrome. In addition to tumors that elaborate ectopic ACTH, an occasional neuro -
endocrine neoplasm produces ectopic CRH, which in turn causes ACTH secretion and hypercortisolism.

As in the pituitary variant, the adrenal glands undergo bilateral cor -
tical hyperplasia secondary to elevated ACTH, but the rapid downhill course of patients with these cancers often cuts short the adrenal enlargement. Primary adrenal neoplasms, such as adrenal adenoma and 
carcinoma, and rarely, primary cortical hyperplasia, are 
responsible for about 15% to 20% of cases of endogenous Cushing syndrome.

This form of Cushing syndrome is 
also designated ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome, or 
adrenal Cushing syndrome, because the adrenals function autonomously. The biochemical hallmark of adrenal Cushing syndrome is elevated levels of cortisol with low serum levels of ACTH. In most cases, adrenal Cushing syndrome is caused by a unilateral adrenocortical neo -
plasm, which may be either benign (adenoma) or malig -
nant (carcinoma).

The overwhelming majority of hyperplastic adrenals are ACTH-dependent, and primary cortical hyperplasia of the adrenal cortices is a rare cause of Cushing syndrome. There are two variants of this entity; the first presents as macronodules of varying sizes (3 cm or greater in diameter) and the second as micronodules 
(1 to 3 mm). Figure  19–35 Schematic representation of the various forms of Cushing syndrome: The three endogenous forms, as well as the more common

MORPHOLOGY
The main lesions of Cushing syndrome are found in the 
pituitary and adrenal glands.

The pituitary in Cushing syn -
drome shows changes that vary with different causes. The most common alteration, resulting from high levels of endog -
enous or exogenous glucocorticoids, is termed 
Crooke  
hyaline  change. In this condition, the normal granular, 
basophilic cytoplasm of the ACTH-producing cells in the anterior pituitary is replaced by homogeneous, lightly baso -
philic material.

This alteration is the result of the accumula -
tion of inter mediate keratin filaments in the cytoplasm. Morphologic changes in the adrenal glands also depend on 
the cause of the hypercortisolism and include: (1) cortical atrophy, (2) diffuse hyperplasia, (3) macronodular or micronodular hyperplasia, or (4) an adenoma or a carcinoma.

In patients in whom the syndrome results from exogenous 
glucocorticoids, suppression of endogenous ACTH results in bilateral 
cortical  atrophy , due to a lack of stimulation of 
the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis by ACTH. The zona glomerulosa is of normal thickness in such cases, because this portion of the cortex functions independently of ACTH. In cases of endogenous hypercortisolism, by contrast, the adre -
nals either are hyperplastic or contain a cortical neoplasm.

Diffuse  hyperplasia is found in patients with ACTH-
dependent Cushing syndrome (Fig. 19–36). Both glands are enlarged, either subtly or markedly, each weighing up to

In primary cortical hyperplasia, the cortex is 
replaced almost entirely by macro-  or micronodules, with 
the latter composed of 1- to 3-mm darkly pigmented nodules. The pigment is believed to be lipofuscin, a wear-and-tear pigment (Chapter 1). Functional  adenomas  or carcinomas of the adrenal 
cortex as the source of cortisol are not morphologically distinct from nonfunctioning adrenal neoplasms (described later).

Both the benign and the malignant lesions are more common in women in their 30s to 50s. Adrenocortical ade-
nomas are yellow tumors surrounded by thin or well-developed capsules, and most weigh less than 30 g ( Fig. 19–37, A). On microscopic examination, they are composed 
of cells similar to those encountered in the normal zona fasciculata (Fig. 19–37, B). The carcinomas associated with 
Cushing syndrome, by contrast, tend to be larger than the adenomas.

These tumors are nonencapsulated masses fre -
quently exceeding 200 to 300 g in weight, having all of the anaplastic characteristics of cancer, as detailed later on. With functioning tumors, both benign and malignant, the adjacent adrenal cortex and that of the contralateral adrenal gland are atrophic, as a result of suppression of endogenous ACTH by high cortisol levels. Clinical Features
The signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome represent an exaggeration of the known actions of glucocorticoids.

Cushing syndrome usually develops gradually and, like many other endocrine abnormalities, may be quite subtle in its early stages. A major exception to this insidious onset is with Cushing syndrome associated with small cell carci -
nomas of the lung, when the rapid course of the underlying disease precludes development of many of the characteris -
tic features. Early manifestations of Cushing syndrome include hypertension and weight gain.

With time, the more 
characteristic centripetal distribution of adipose tissue becomes apparent, with resultant truncal obesity, “moon facies,” and accumulation of fat in the posterior neck and

back (“buffalo hump”) ( Fig. 19–38). Hypercortisolism 
causes selective atrophy of fast-twitch (type II) myofibers, 
with resultant decreased muscle mass and proximal limb weakness. Glucocorticoids induce gluconeogenesis and inhibit the uptake of glucose by cells, with resultant hyper-
glycemia, glucosuria, and polydipsia, mimicking diabetes 
mellitus. The catabolic effects on proteins cause loss of col-lagen and resorption of bone.

Thus, the skin is thin, fragile, and easily bruised; cutaneous striae are particularly common 
in the abdominal area. Bone resorption results in the devel-opment of osteoporosis, with consequent increased suscep-
tibility to fractures. Because glucocorticoids suppress the immune response, patients with Cushing syndrome also are at increased risk for a variety of infections.

Additional manifestations include hirsutism and menstrual abnormali-
ties, as well as a number of mental disturbances, including 
mood swings, depression, and frank psychosis. Extra -
adrenal Cushing syndrome caused by pituitary or ectopic ACTH secretion usually is associated with increased skin pigmentation secondary to melanocyte-stimulating activ-ity in the ACTH precursor molecule. Figure  19–38 A patient with Cushing syndrome.

Characteristic features 
include central obesity, “moon facies,” and abdominal striae. (Reproduced with permission from Lloyd RV, et al: Atlas of Nontumor Pathology: Endocrine 
Diseases. Washington, DC, American Registry of Pathology, 2002.)
Hyperaldosteronism
Hyperaldosteronism is the generic term for a group of closely 
related conditions characterized by chronic excess aldos -
terone secretion. Hyperaldosteronism may be primary, or it may be secondary to an extraadrenal cause.

In secondary 
hyperaldosteronism, aldosterone release occurs in response to activation of the renin-angiotensin system.

This condi -
tion is characterized by increased levels of plasma renin and 
is encountered in association with
- Decreased renal perfusion (arteriolar nephrosclerosis, 
renal artery stenosis)
- Arterial hypovolemia and edema (congestive heart 
failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome)
- Pregnancy (caused by estrogen-induced increases in 
plasma renin substrate)
Primary hyperaldosteronism, by contrast, indicates a primary, autonomous overproduction of aldosterone, with resultant suppression of the renin-angiotensin system and decreased 
plasma renin activity.

The potential causes of primary hyper-aldosteronism are:
- Bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism, characterized by bilateral nodular hyperplasia of the adrenal glands. This mechanism is the most common underlying cause of primary hyperaldosteronism, accounting for about 60% of cases. The pathogenesis is unclear. - Adrenocortical neoplasm, either an aldosterone-producing adenoma (the most common cause) or, rarely, an adre -
nocortical carcinoma.

In approximately 35% of cases, primary hyperaldosteronism is caused by a solitary aldosterone-secreting adenoma, a condition referred to as Conn syndrome. - Rarely, familial hyperaldosteronism may result from a 
genetic defect that leads to overactivity of the aldosterone 
synthase gene, CYP11B2. SUMMARY
Hypercortisolism (Cushing Syndrome)
- The most common cause of hypercortisolism is exo g­
enous administration of steroids.

- Endogenous hyper cortisolism most often is secondary to 
an ACTH ­producing pituitary microadenoma ( Cushing 
disease), followed by primary adrenal neoplasms 
(ACTH-independent hypercortisolism) and paraneoplastic ACTH production by tumors (e.g., small cell lung cancer).

- The morphologic features in the adrenal include bilateral 
cortical atrophy (in exogenous steroid ­induced disease), 
bilateral diffuse or nodular hyperplasia (most common finding in endogenous Cushing syndrome), or an adreno ­
cortical neoplasm. MORPHOLOGY
Aldosterone-producing  adenomas are almost always 
solitary, small (less than 2 cm in diameter), well-circumscribed lesions.

They are bright yellow on cut section and, surpris -
ingly, are composed of lipid-laden cortical cells more closely resembling fasciculata cells than glomerulosa cells (the normal source of aldosterone). In general, the cells tend to be uniform in size and shape; occasionally there is some nuclear and cellular pleomorphism. A characteristic feature of aldosterone-producing adenomas is the presence of eosino -
philic, laminated cytoplasmic inclusions, known as spirono-
lactone  bodies.

These typically are found after treatment 
with the antihypertensive agent spironolactone, which is the

precursor steroids, which are then channeled into synthesis 
of androgens with virilizing activity. Certain enzyme defects also may impair aldosterone secretion, adding salt loss to the virilizing syndrome. The most common enzymatic 
defect in CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which accounts for 
more than 90% of cases.

21-Hydroxylase deficiency may range in degree from a total lack to a mild loss, depending on the nature of the underlying mutation involving the CYP21A2 gene, which encodes this enzyme. Clinical Features
The clinical hallmark of hyperaldosteronism is hypertension . With an estimated prevalence rate of 5% to 10% among 
unselected hypertensive patients, primary hyperaldos -
teronism may be the most common cause of secondary hypertension (i.e., hypertension secondary to an identifi -
able cause).

The long-term effects of hyperaldosteronism-induced hypertension are cardiovascular compromise (e.g., left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced diastolic volumes) and an increase in the prevalence of adverse events such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Hypokale-
mia results from renal potassium wasting and, when present, can cause a variety of neuromuscular manifesta -
tions, including weakness, paresthesias, visual distur -
bances, and occasionally frank tetany.

In primary hyperaldosteronism, the therapy varies according to cause. Adenomas are amenable to surgical excision. By contrast, surgical intervention is not very beneficial in patients 
with primary hyperaldosteronism due to bilateral hyper -
plasia, which often occurs in children and young adults. These patients are best managed medically with an 
aldosterone antagonist such as spironolactone.

The treatment 
of secondary hyperaldosteronism rests on correcting 
the underlying cause of the renin-angiotensin system hyperstimulation. Adrenogenital Syndromes
Excess of androgens may be caused by a number of 
diseases, including primary gonadal disorders and 
several primary adrenal disorders. The adrenal cortex secretes two compounds—dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione—which require conversion to testoster -
one in peripheral tissues for their androgenic effects.

Unlike gonadal androgens, adrenal androgen formation is regu -
lated by ACTH; thus, excessive secretion can present as an isolated syndrome or in combination with features of Cushing disease. The adrenal causes of androgen excess include adrenocortical neoplasms and an uncommon group 
of disorders collectively designated congenital adrenal hyper-
plasia (CAH). Adrenocortical neoplasms associated with symptoms of androgen excess ( virilization) are more likely 
to be carcinomas than adenomas.

They are morphologi -
cally identical to other functional or nonfunctional cortical neoplasms. CAH represents a group of autosomal recessive disor -
ders, each characterized by a hereditary defect in an enzyme involved in adrenal steroid biosynthesis, particularly cor -
tisol. In these conditions, decreased cortisol production results in a compensatory increase in ACTH secretion due to absence of feedback inhibition.

The resultant adrenal hyperplasia causes increased production of cortisol MORPHOLOGY
In all cases of CAH, the adrenals are hyperplastic  bilater -
ally, sometimes expanding to 10 to 15 times their normal weights. The adrenal cortex is thickened and nodular, and on cut section, the widened cortex appears brown as a result of depletion of all lipid. The proliferating cells mostly are compact, eosinophilic, lipid-depleted cells, intermixed with lipid-laden clear cells.

In addition to cortical abnormalities, 
adrenomedullary  dysplasia also has recently been 
reported in patients with the salt-losing 21-hydroxylase defi-ciency. This is characterized by incomplete migration of the chromaffin cells to the center of the gland, with pronounced intermingling of nests of chromaffin and cortical cells in the periphery. Hyperplasia of corticotroph (ACTH-producing) cells is present in the anterior pituitary in most patients. drug of choice in primary hyperaldosteronism.

In contrast with cortical adenomas associated with Cushing syndrome, those associated with hyperaldosteronism do not usually sup -
press ACTH secretion. Therefore, the adjacent adrenal cortex and that of the contralateral gland are not atrophic. Bilateral  idiopathic  hyperplasia is marked by diffuse or 
focal hyperplasia of cells resembling those of the normal zona glomerulosa.

Clinical Features
The clinical manifestations of CAH are determined by the specific enzyme deficiency and include abnormalities related to androgen metabolism, sodium homeostasis, and (in severe cases) glucocorticoid deficiency. Depending on the nature and severity of the enzymatic defect, the onset of clinical symptoms may occur in the perinatal period, later childhood, or (less commonly) adulthood.

In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, excessive androgenic activity 
causes signs of masculinization in females, ranging from clitoral hypertrophy and pseudohermaphroditism in infants to oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, and acne in postpu -
bertal girls. In males, androgen excess is associated with enlargement of the external genitalia and other evidence of precocious puberty in prepubertal patients and with oligo -
spermia in older patients.

In some forms of CAH (e.g., 11β-hydroxylase deficiency), the accumulated intermedi -
ary steroids have mineralocorticoid activity, with resultant sodium retention and hypertension. In other cases, however, 
including about one third of persons with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the enzymatic defect is severe enough to produce mineralocorticoid deficiency, with resultant salt 
(sodium) wasting. Cortisol deficiency places persons with CAH at risk for acute adrenal insufficiency (discussed later).

CAH should be suspected in any neonate with ambigu -
ous genitalia; severe enzyme deficiency in infancy can be a life-threatening condition, with vomiting, dehydration, and salt wasting. In the milder variants, women may present with delayed menarche, oligomenorrhea, or hirsut -
ism. In all such cases, an androgen-producing ovarian neo -
plasm must be excluded.

Treatment of CAH is with exogenous glucocorticoids, which, in addition to providing adequate levels of glucocorticoids, also suppress ACTH levels, thereby decreasing the excessive synthesis of the

remains unclear but probably involves endotoxin-induced 
vascular injury with associated disseminated intravascular coagulation (Chapter 3). Chronic Adrenocortical Insufficiency: 
Addison Disease
Addison disease, or chronic adrenocortical insufficiency, is an uncommon disorder resulting from progressive destruc-tion of the adrenal cortex.

More than 90% of all cases are attributable to one of four disorders: autoimmune adrenalitis, 
tuberculosis, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 
or metastatic cancer (Table 19–7). - Autoimmune adrenalitis accounts for 60% to 70% of cases and is by far the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in developed countries.

As the name implies, there is autoimmune destruction of steroid-producing cells, and autoantibodies to several key steroid hormones responsible for many of the clinical abnormalities. SUMMARY
Adrenogenital Syndromes
- The adrenal cortex can secrete excess androgens in 
either of two settings: adrenocortical neoplasms (usually virilizing carcinomas) or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).

- CAH consists of a group of autosomal recessive disorders 
characterized by defects in steroid biosynthesis, usually cortisol; the most common subtype is caused by defi ­
ciency of the enzyme 21 ­hydroxylase. - Reduction in cortisol pr oduction causes a compensatory 
increase in ACTH secretion, which in turn stimulates androgen production.

Androgens have virilizing effects, including masculinization in females (ambiguous genitalia, oligomenorrhea, hirsutism), precocious puberty in males, and in some instances, salt (sodium) wasting and hypotension. - Bilateral hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex is 
characteristic.

ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY
Adrenocortical insufficiency, or hypofunction, may be 
caused by either primary adrenal disease (primary hypo -
adrenalism) or decreased stimulation of the adrenals 
resulting from a deficiency of ACTH (secondary hypo -
adrenalism).

The patterns of adrenocortical insufficiency can be divided into three general categories: (1) primary acute adrenocortical insufficiency (adrenal crisis); (2) primary chronic adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison 
disease); and (3) secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Acute Adrenocortical Insufficiency
Acute adrenocortical insufficiency occurs most commonly in the clinical settings listed in Table 19–7.

Persons with 
chronic adrenocortical insufficiency may develop an acute crisis after any stress that taxes their limited physiologic reserves. In patients maintained on exogenous corticoste -
roids, rapid withdrawal of steroids or failure to increase steroid doses in response to an acute stress may precipitate a similar adrenal crisis, because of the inability of the 
atrophic adrenals to produce glucocorticoid hormones.

Massive adrenal hemorrhage may destroy enough of the 
adrenal cortex to cause acute adrenocortical insufficiency. This condition may occur in patients maintained on anti-coagulant therapy, in postoperative patients who develop disseminated intravascular coagulation, during pregnancy, and in patients suffering from overwhelming sepsis; in this last setting it is known as the Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome (Fig. 19–39).

This catastrophic syndrome is clas -
sically associated with Neisseria meningitidis septicemia but 
can also be caused by other organisms, including Pseudo-
monas spp., pneumococci, and Haemophilus influenzae. The 
pathogenesis of the Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome

may be normal, but the destruction of the adrenal cortex 
does not permit a response to exogenously administered ACTH in the form of increased plasma levels of cortisol. By contrast, secondary adrenocortical insufficiency is char -
acterized by low serum ACTH and a prompt rise in plasma cortisol levels in response to ACTH administration.steroidogenic enzymes have been detected in affected patients.

Autoimmune adrenalitis occurs in one of two autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes: APS1, which is 
caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) 
gene on chromosome 21 and is characterized by chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and abnormalities of skin, dental enamel, and nails (ectodermal dystrophy) occur -
ring in association with a combination of organ-specific autoimmune disorders (autoimmune adrenalitis, auto -
immune hypoparathyroidism, idiopathic hypogonad-ism, pernicious anemia) that result in destruction of target organs.

The AIRE protein is involved in the expression of tissue antigens in the thymus and the elimination of T cells specific for these antigens ( Chapter 
4. . The second setting is that of APS2, which manifests in early adulthood and manifests as a combination of adrenal insufficiency and autoimmune thyroiditis or type 1 diabetes. Unlike in APS1, in APS2 mucocutaneous candidiasis, ectodermal dysplasia, and autoimmune hypoparathyroidism do not occur.

- Infections, particularly tuberculosis and those produced by fungi, also may cause primary chronic adrenocortical insufficiency. Tuberculous adrenalitis, which once accounted for as many as 90% of cases of Addison disease, has become less common with the advent of antituberculosis therapy. With the resurgence of tuber -
culosis in many urban centers, however, this cause of adrenal deficiency must be borne in mind.

When present, tuberculous adrenalitis usually is associated with 
active infection in other sites, particularly the lungs and genitourinary tract. Among fungi, disseminated infec -
tions caused by Histoplasma capsulatum and Coccidioides 
immitis also may result in chronic adrenocortical insuf -
ficiency.

Patients with AIDS are at risk for the develop -
ment of adrenal insufficiency from several infectious (cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare) 
and noninfectious (Kaposi sarcoma) complications of their disease. - Metastatic neoplasms involving the adrenals are another potential cause of adrenal insufficiency. The adrenals are a fairly common site for metastases in patients with dis -
seminated carcinomas.

Although adrenal function is preserved in most such instances, the metastatic growths sometimes destroy sufficient adrenal cortex to produce a degree of adrenal insufficiency. Carcinomas of the lung and breast are the source of a majority of metasta-ses in the adrenals, although many other neoplasms, including gastrointestinal carcinomas, malignant mela-nomas, and hematopoietic neoplasms, also may metas -
tasize to the organ.

Secondary Adrenocortical Insufficiency
Any disorder of the hypothalamus and pituitary, such as metastatic cancer, infection, infarction, or irradiation, that reduces the output of ACTH leads to a syndrome of hypo -
adrenalism having many similarities to Addison disease. With secondary disease, the hyperpigmentation of primary Addison disease is lacking because melanotropic hormone levels are low (discussed later).

ACTH deficiency may occur alone, but in some instances, it is only one part of panhypopitu -
itarism, associated with multiple tropic hormone deficien -
cies. In patients with primary disease, serum ACTH levels MORPHOLOGY
The appearance of the adrenal glands varies with the cause of the adrenocortical insufficiency. In 
secondary  hypo -
adrenalism the adrenals are reduced to small, flattened structures that usually retain their yellow color because of a small amount of residual lipid.

A uniform, thin rim of atrophic yellow cortex surrounds a central, intact medulla. Histologic evaluation reveals atrophy of cortical cells with loss of cyto -
plasmic lipid, particularly in the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis. Primary 
autoimmune  adrenalitis is charac -
terized by irregularly shrunken glands, which may be exceed -
ingly difficult to identify within the suprarenal adipose tissue.

On histologic examination, the cortex contains only scattered residual cortical cells in a collapsed network of connective tissue. A variable lymphoid infiltrate is present in the cortex and may extend into the subjacent medulla ( Fig. 19–40). The 
medulla is otherwise preserved. In 
tuberculosis  or fungal  
diseases, the adrenal architecture may be effaced by a gran -
ulomatous inflammatory reaction identical to that encoun -
tered in other sites of infection.

When hypoadrenalism is caused by 
metastatic  carcinoma, the adrenals are 
enlarged, and their normal architecture is obscured by the infiltrating neoplasm. Figure  19–40 Autoimmune adrenalitis . In addition to loss of all but a 
subcapsular rim of cortical cells, there is an extensive mononuclear cell 
infiltrate. Clinical Features
In general, clinical manifestations of adrenocortical insuf -
ficiency do not appear until at least 90% of the adrenal 
cortex has been compromised.

The initial manifestations often include progressive weakness and easy fatigability, which may be dismissed as nonspecific complaints. Gastro-
intestinal disturbances are common and include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and diarrhea. In patients with primary adrenal disease, increased levels of ACTH precursor hormone stimulate melanocytes, with resultant hyperpigmentation of the skin and mucosal surfaces. The

759 Adrenocortical Neoplasms
ADRENOCORTICAL NEOPLASMS
It should be evident from the discussion of adrenocortical 
hyperfunction that functional adrenal neoplasms may be 
responsible for any of the various forms of hyperadren -
alism. While functional adenomas are most commonly associated with hyperaldosteronism and with Cushing syndrome, a virilizing neoplasm is more likely to be a car -
cinoma. Not all adrenocortical neoplasms, however, elabo -
rate steroid hormones.

Determination of whether a cortical neoplasm is functional or not is based on clinical evaluation and measurement of the hormone or its metabolites in the laboratory.face, axillae, nipples, areolae, and perineum are particu -
larly common sites of hyperpigmentation. By contrast, 
hyperpigmentation is not seen in patients with secondary adrenocortical insufficiency.

Decreased mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) activity in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency results in potassium retention and sodium loss, with consequent hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, volume 
depletion, and hypotension
, whereas secondary hypoadren -
alism is characterized by deficient cortisol and androgen output but normal or near-normal aldosterone synthesis. Hypoglycemia occasionally may occur as a result of gluco-corticoid deficiency and impaired gluconeogenesis.

Stresses such as infections, trauma, or surgical procedures in affected patients may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis, manifested by intractable vomiting, abdominal pain, hypo -
tension, coma, and vascular collapse. Death follows rapidly unless corticosteroids are replaced immediately. SUMMARY
Adrenocortical Insufficiency (Hypoadrenalism)
- Primary adrenocortical insufficiency can be acute 
(Waterhouse ­Friderichsen syndrome) or chronic (Addison 
disease).

- Chronic adrenal insufficiency in the Western world most 
often is secondary to autoimmune adrenalitis, which occurs in the context of one of two autoimmune poly­endocrine syndromes: APS1 (caused by mutations in the AIRE gene) or APS2. - T uberculosis and infections due to opportunistic patho ­
gens associated with the human immunodeficiency virus and tumors metastatic to the adrenals are the other important causes of chronic hypoadrenalism.

- Patients typically present with fatigue, weakness, and gas ­
trointestinal disturbances. Primary adrenocortical insuffi ­
ciency also is characterized by high ACTH levels with associated skin pigmentation. MORPHOLOGY
Adrenocortical  adenomas were described earlier in the 
discussions of Cushing syndrome and hyperaldosteronism.

Most cortical adenomas do not cause hyperfunction and usually are encountered as incidental findings at the time 
of autopsy or during abdominal imaging for an unrelated cause. In fact, the half-facetious appellation of 
“adrenal

incidentaloma” has crept into the medical lexicon to describe these incidentally discovered tumors. On cut surface, adenomas usually are yellow to yellow-brown, owing to the presence of lipid within the neoplastic cells (Fig. 19–37). As a general rule they are small, averaging 1 to 2 cm in diameter. On microscopic examination, adenomas are com -
posed of cells similar to those populating the normal adrenal cortex.

The nuclei tend to be small, although some degree of pleomorphism may be encountered even in benign lesions 
(endocrine  atypia). The cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells 
ranges from eosinophilic to vacuolated, depending on their lipid content; mitotic activity generally is inconspicuous. Adrenocortical  carcinomas are rare neoplasms that 
may occur at any age, including in childhood.

Two rare inher -
ited causes of adrenal cortical carcinomas are Li-Fraumeni syndrome (Chapter 5) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (Chapter 6). In most cases, adrenocortical carcinomas are large, invasive lesions that efface the native adrenal gland. On cut surface, adrenocortical carcinomas typically are varie -
gated, poorly demarcated lesions containing areas of necro-sis, hemorrhage, and cystic change ( Fig. 19–41).

Microscopic 
examination typically shows these tumors to be composed of well-differentiated cells resembling those seen in cortical adenomas or bizarre, pleomorphic cells, which may be 
difficult to distinguish from those of an undifferentiated car -
cinoma metastatic to the adrenal ( Fig. 19–42). Adrenal

ADRENAL  MEDULLA
The adrenal medulla is embryologically, functionally, and 
structurally distinct from the adrenal cortex. It is populated by cells derived from the neural crest (chromaffin cells) and their supporting (sustentacular) cells.

The chromaffin cells, so named because of their brown-black color after exposure to potassium dichromate, synthesize and secrete catechol -
amines in response to signals from preganglionic nerve fibers in the sympathetic nervous system. Similar collec -
tions of cells are distributed throughout the body in the extraadrenal paraganglion system.

The most important diseases of the adrenal medulla are neoplasms, which include both neuronal neoplasms (including neuroblasto -
mas and more mature ganglion cell tumors) and neoplasms composed of chromaffin cells (pheochromocytomas). TUMORS OF THE ADRENAL 
MEDULLA
Pheochromocytoma
Pheochromocytomas are neoplasms composed of chromaf -
fin cells, which, like their non-neoplastic counterparts, syn -
thesize and release catecholamines and, in some cases, other peptide hormones.

These tumors are of special importance because although uncommon, they (like aldosterone-secreting adenomas) give rise to a surgically correctable form of hypertension. Pheochromocytomas usually subscribe to a convenient 
“rule of 10s”:
- 10% of pheochromocytomas are extraadrenal, occurring in 
sites such as the organ of Zuckerkandl and the carotid body, where they usually are called paragangliomas, 
rather than pheochromocytomas.

- 10% of adrenal pheochromocytomas are bilateral ; this pro-
portion may rise to 50% in cases that are associated with familial syndromes. - 10% of adrenal pheochromocytomas are malignant, although the associated hypertension represents a serious and potentially lethal complication of even benign tumors. Frank malignancy is somewhat more common in tumors arising in extraadrenal sites. - One “traditional” 10% rule that has since been modified 
pertains to familial cases.

It is now recognized that as 
many as 25% of persons with pheochromocytomas and para -
gangliomas harbor a germ line mutation in one of at least 
six known genes, including RET, which causes type 2 
MEN syndromes (described later); NF1, which causes 
type 1 neurofibromatosis (Chapter 21); VHL, which 
causes von Hippel-Lindau disease ( Chapters 13 and 
22.

; and three genes encoding subunits within the suc -
cinate dehydrogenase complex ( SDHB, SDHC, and MORPHOLOGY
Pheochromocytomas range in size from small, circumscribed lesions confined to the adrenal to large, hemorrhagic masses weighing several kilograms. On cut surface, smaller pheo -
chromocytomas are yellow-tan, well-defined lesions that compress the adjacent adrenal ( Fig. 19–43). Larger lesions 
tend to be hemorrhagic, necrotic, and cystic and typically efface the adrenal gland.

Incubation of the fresh tissue with potassium dichromate solutions turns the tumor dark brown, as noted previously. On microscopic examination, pheochromocytomas are 
composed of polygonal to spindle-shaped chromaffin cells and their supporting cells, compartmentalized into small nests, or Zellballen, by a rich vascular network ( Fig. 19–44).

The cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells often has a finely granu -
lar appearance, highlighted by a variety of silver stains, because of the presence of granules containing catechol -
amines. Electron microscopy reveals variable numbers of membrane-bound, electron-dense granules, representing catecholamines and sometimes other peptides. The nuclei of the neoplastic cells are often quite pleomorphic. Both

elevation in blood pressure, associated with tachycardia, 
palpitations, headache, sweating, tremor, and a sense of apprehension. Such episodes also may be associated with pain in the abdomen or chest, nausea, and vomiting. In clinical practice, isolated, paroxysmal episodes of hypertension 
occur in fewer than half of patients with pheochromocytoma.

In about two thirds of patients the hypertension occurs in the form of a chronic, sustained elevation in blood pres -
sure, although an element of labile hypertension often is present as well. Whether sustained or episodic, the hyper -
tension is associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischemia, heart failure, renal injury, and stroke (cerebro-vascular accident).

Sudden cardiac death may occur, prob -
ably secondary to catecholamine-induced myocardial irritability and ventricular arrhythmias. In some cases, pheochromocytomas secrete other hormones such as ACTH and somatostatin and may therefore be associated with clinical features related to the effects of these and other peptide hormones.

The laboratory diagnosis of pheo-chromocytoma is based on demonstration of increased urinary excretion of free catecholamines and their metabo -
lites, such as vanillylmandelic acid and metanephrines. Isolated benign pheochromocytomas are treated with sur -
gical excision. With multifocal lesions, long-term medical treatment for hypertension may be required. Neuroblastoma and Other Neuronal Neoplasms
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood.

These neoplasms occur most com-monly during the first 5 years of life and may arise during infancy. Neuroblastomas may occur anywhere in the sym -
pathetic nervous system and occasionally within the brain, but they are most common in the abdomen; a majority of these tumors arise in either the adrenal medulla or the retroperitoneal sympathetic ganglia. Most neuroblastomas are sporadic, although familial cases also have been described.

These tumors are discussed in Chapter 6, along with other pediatric neoplasms. Figure  19–44 Photomicrograph of pheochromocytoma, demonstrat -
ing characteristic nests of cells (Zellballen) with abundant cytoplasm. Granules containing catecholamine are not visible in this preparation. It is not uncommon to find bizarre cells even in pheochromocytomas that are biologically benign, and this criterion by itself should not be used to diagnose malignancy.

Clinical Features
The predominant clinical manifestation of pheochromocy -
toma is hypertension. The characteristic presentation with a 
hypertensive episode is one of abrupt, precipitous capsular and vascular invasion may be encountered in benign 
lesions, and the mere presence of mitotic figures does not imply malignancy. Therefore,  the definitive  diagnosis  of

sively  on the presence  of metastases.

These may 
involve regional lymph nodes as well as more distant sites, including liver, lung, and bone. MULTIPLE  ENDOCRINE  NEOPLASIA  SYNDROMES
The MEN syndromes are a group of inherited diseases resulting in proliferative lesions (hyperplasias, adenomas, and carcinomas) of multiple endocrine organs.

Like other inherited cancer disorders (Chapter 5), endocrine tumors arising in the context of MEN syndromes have certain 
distinctive features that are not shared with their sporadic counterparts:
- These tumors occur at a younger age than that typical for 
sporadic cancers. - They arise in multiple endocrine organs, either synchro-
nously or metachronously. - Even in one organ, the tumors often are multifocal.

- The tumors usually are preceded by an asymptomatic 
stage of endocrine hyperplasia involving the cell of origin 
of the tumor (for example, patients with MEN-2 
almost universally demonstrate C cell hyperplasia in the thyroid parenchyma adjacent to medullary thyroid carcinomas).• These tumors are usually more aggressive and recur in a 
higher proportion of cases than similar endocrine tumors that occur sporadically.

Unraveling the genetic basis of the MEN syndromes with clinical application of this knowledge in therapeutic deci -
sion making has been one of the success stories of transla -
tional research. The salient features of the MEN syndromes are discussed next. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia T ype 1
MEN type 1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

The gene ( MEN1) is located at 11q13 and is a tumor sup -
pressor gene; thus, inactivation of both alleles of the gene is believed to be the basis for tumorigenesis. Organs most commonly involved are the parathyroid, the pancreas, and the pituitary—the “3 Ps.”

## Page 776

C H A P T E R 19 762 Endocrine System
- Parathyroid: Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most 
common manifestation of MEN-1 (80% to 95% of 
patients) and is the initial manifestation of the disorder in most patients, appearing in almost all patients by age 40 to 50. Parathyroid abnormalities include both hyper -
plasia and adenomas. - Pancreas: Endocrine tumors of the pancreas are the leading cause of death in MEN-1. These tumors usually are aggressive and manifest with metastatic disease.

It is not uncommon to find multiple “microadenomas” scattered throughout the pancreas in conjunction with one or two dominant lesions. Pancreatic endocrine tumors often are functional (i.e., secrete hormones). Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, associated with gastrino -
mas, and hypoglycemia, related to insulinomas, are common endocrine manifestations. Of note, the gastri -
nomas arising in MEN-1 syndrome are far more likely to be located within the duodenum than in the pancreas.

- Pituitary: The most frequent pituitary tumor in patients with MEN-1 is a prolactin-secreting macroadenoma. In some cases, acromegaly develops in association with somatotropin-secreting tumors. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia T ype 2
MEN type 2 actually comprises two distinct groups of 
disorders that are unified by the occurrence of activating (i.e., gain-of-function) mutations of the RET proto-oncogene 
at chromosomal locus 10q11.2.

A strong genotype-phenotype 
correlation has been recognized for the MEN-2 syndromes, and differences in mutation patterns account for the vari -
able features in the two subtypes. MEN-2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2A
Organs commonly involved in MEN type 2A include
- Thyroid: Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid develops in virtually all untreated cases, and the tumors usually occur in the first 2 decades of life.

The tumors commonly are multifocal, and foci of C cell hyperplasia can be found in the adjacent thyroid. Familial medullary thyroid 
cancer is a variant of MEN-2A characterized by medul -
lary thyroid cancers, but not the other characteristic manifestations listed here. In comparison with MEN-2, familial medullary carcinoma typically occurs at an older age and follows a more indolent course.

- Adrenal medulla: Adrenal pheochromocytomas develop in 50% of the patients; fortunately, no more than 10% of these tumors are malignant. - Parathyroid: Approximately 10% to 20% of patients develop parathyroid gland hyperplasia with manifesta-tions of primary hyperparathyroidism. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2B
Patients with MEN-2B harbor a distinct germline RET 
mutation involving a single–amino acid change. Organs commonly involved include the thyroid and the adrenal medulla.

The spectrum of thyroid and adrenal medullary disease is similar to that in MEN-2A, with the following differences:
- Primary hyperparathyroidism does not develop in patients 
with MEN-2B. - Extraendocrine manifestations are characteristic in patients 
with MEN-2B. These include ganglioneuromas of mucosal sites (gastrointestinal tract, lips, tongue) and a marfanoid habitus, in which overly long bones of the axial skeleton give an appearance resembling that in Marfan syndrome (Chapter 6).

Before the advent of genetic testing, relatives of patients with the MEN-2 syndrome were screened with annual bio-chemical tests, which often lacked sensitivity. Now, routine genetic testing identifies RET mutation carriers earlier and 
more reliably in MEN-2 kindreds; all persons carrying germ-
line RET mutations are advised to have prophylactic thyroidec -
tomy to prevent the inevitable development of medullary carcinomas.

The musculoskeletal system and the integrated neural con -
nections enable locomotion by the human body.

Aside 
from providing the fulcrums and levers against which muscles contract to allow movement, the skeleton is critical for mineral (particularly calcium) homeostasis and also protects viscera and supplies an environment conducive to both hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cell develop-ment.

The term diseases of the bones and joints embraces a large number of conditions ranging from localized, benign tumors of bone and soft tissue such as the osteo -
chondroma and lipoma, respectively, to generalized disor -
ders such as osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta. In this chapter we will first consider some of the more common conditions affecting the bones and joints, then discuss tumors arising in the various soft tissues of the body.

Dis -
eases of the muscles and peripheral nerves are discussed in Chapter 21. Bones, Joints, and Soft 
Tissue T umors
BONES
The skeletal system is composed of 206 bones that vary in size and shape and are interconnected by a variety of joints that allow for a wide range of movement and promote structural stability. Bones are composed of a unique type of mineralized connective tissue that undergoes mineral -
ization with a distinctive admixture of organic matrix (35%) and inorganic elements (65%).

The inorganic mineral 
com ponent consists mainly of calcium hydroxyapatite 
[Ca 10(PO 4)6(OH) 2]. This mineral gives bone strength and 
hardness and serves as the storehouse for 99% of the body’s calcium, 85% of the body’s phosphorus, and 65% of the body’s sodium and magnesium. The organic component See T argeted Therapy available online at

function.

Osteoclasts are derived from the same stem cells that produce macrophages. RANK ( receptor activator for nuclear factor- κB) receptors 
on osteoclast precursors bind RANK ligand (RANKL) expressed by osteoblasts and marrow stromal cells. Along with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), the RANK-RANKL interaction drives the differentiation of functional osteoclasts.

Stromal cells also secrete osteo -
protegerin (OPG), which acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL, preventing it from binding the RANK receptor on osteoclast precursors. Conse -
quently, OPG prevents bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation. STROMAL CELL /

BONERANKincludes the cells of bone and the proteinaceous osteoid.

The bone-forming cells include osteoblasts and osteocytes, 
while cells of the bone-digesting lineage include osteoclast precursor cells and mature functional osteoclasts ( Fig. 20–1). To the uninitiated, bone appears to be an inert, stable 
tissue, but in fact it is very dynamic and subject to constant breakdown and renewal, a process referred to as remodel-
ing.

The net effects of remodeling may be bone mainte -
nance, bone loss, or bone deposition, with the balance being determined by the relative activities of osteoblasts, which deposit bone, and osteoclasts, which resorb bone (Fig. 20–1, A and B).

As might be imagined, osteoblast and 
osteoclast activity is highly regulated and tightly integrated under normal circumstances, both by local crosstalk between these two cell types and by circulating factors that impact their activity, such as vitamin D and parathyroid hormone. Among the local factors that regulate bone remodeling, 
the most important are RANK (receptor activator for nuclear factor-κB), RANK ligand (RANKL), and osteopro -
tegerin (OPG) (Fig 20–2).

RANK, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, is expressed on the cell membranes of preosteoclasts and mature osteoclasts. Its ligand, RANKL, is expressed by osteoblasts and marrow stromal cells. RANK stimulation by RANKL leads to acti -
vation of the transcription factor NF- κB, which drives the 
expression of genes that stimulate osteoclast formation, fusion, differentiation, function, and survival.

RANKL pro -
duction is upregulated by factors that stimulate osteoclastic activity. The actions of RANKL can be blocked by another member of the TNF receptor family, OPG, which is a “decoy” receptor produced by a number of tissues includ -
ing bone, hematopoietic marrow, and immune cells. OPG competitively binds to RANKL, preventing RANK from interacting with RANKL. OPG production is regulated by signals similar to those that stimulate RANKL.

Therefore, these molecules enable osteoblasts and stromal cells to control osteoclast development and activity and provide a mechanism for a wide variety of biologic mediators (hor -
mones, cytokines, growth factors) to influence the homeo-stasis of bone tissue and bone mass.

collagen but at only reduced levels generally have milder 
manifestations. The fundamental abnormality in all forms of OI is too little 
bone, resulting in extreme skeletal fragility. Four major sub -
types are recognized. The type II variant is uniformly fatal in utero or immediately postpartum as a consequence of multiple fractures that occur before birth.

By contrast, patients with type I OI have a normal lifespan, with only a modestly increased proclivity for fractures during child -
hood (decreasing in frequency after puberty). The classic finding of blue sclerae in type I OI is attributable to decreased 
scleral collagen content; this deficit causes a relative trans -
parency that allows the underlying choroid to be seen.

Hearing loss can be related to conduction defects in the middle and inner ear bones, and small misshapen teeth are a 
result of dentin deficiency. Achondroplasia and Thanatophoric Dwarfism
Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism. It is 
caused by activating point mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor with tyrosine kinase activity that transmits intracellular signals.

Signals trans-mitted by FGFR3 inhibit the proliferation and function of 
growth plate chondrocytes; consequently, the growth of normal epiphyseal plates is suppressed, and the length 
of long bones is severely stunted. The disorder can be inherited in autosomal dominant fashion, but many cases arise from new spontaneous mutations. Achondroplasia affects all bones that develop by enchon -
dral ossification.

The most conspicuous changes include short stature, disproportionate shortening of the proximal extremities, bowing of the legs, and frontal bossing with midface hypoplasia. The cartilage of the growth plates is disorganized and hypoplastic. Thanatophoric dwarfism is a lethal variant of dwarfism, 
affecting 1 in every 20,000 live births (thanatophoric means “death-loving”). This disease is caused by missense or point mutations most commonly located in the extracel -
lular domains of FGFR3.

Affected heterozygotes exhibit extreme shortening of the limbs, frontal bossing of the skull, and an extremely small thorax, which is the cause of fatal respiratory failure in the perinatal period. Osteopetrosis
Osteopetrosis is a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by defective osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Osteopetrosis (literally, “bone-that-is-like-stone disorder”) is an appro -
priate name, since the bones are dense, solid, and stone- 
like.

Paradoxically, because turnover is decreased, the 
persisting bone tissue becomes weak over time and predis -
posed to fractures like a piece of chalk. Several variants 
are known, the two most common being an autosomal dominant adult form with mild clinical manifestations, 
and autosomal recessive infantile, with a severe/lethal phenotype.

The defects that cause osteopetrosis are categorized into 
those that disturb osteoclast function and those that inter -
fere with osteoclast formation and differentiation. The Primary and secondary diseases of bone are varied and 
numerous and are classified in this chapter according to their perceived biologic defect or pathologic process.

CONGENITAL DISORDERS OF BONE 
AND CARTILAGE
Congenital disorders of the skeleton are various and, 
depending on the resulting defect, become manifest at 
different ages. The most severe produce developmental abnormalities that are evident from the earliest stages of skeletogenesis.

- Developmental anomalies resulting from localized 
problems in the migration of mesenchymal cells and the formation of condensations are called dysostoses and 
may affect individual or a group of bones and can result from mutations in specific homeobox genes.

The more common lesions include aplasia (e.g., congenital absence 
of a digit or rib), the formation of extra bones (e.g., supernumerary digits or ribs), and abnormal fusion of bones (e.g., premature closure of the cranial sutures or congenital fusion of the ribs). Such malformations may occur as isolated, sporadic lesions or as components of a more complex syndrome.

- Mutations that interfere with bone or cartilage forma -
tion, growth, and/or maintenance of normal matrix components have more diffuse effects; such disorders are called dysplasias—more specifically, osteodysplasias 
and chondrodysplasias. Dysplasia in this context refers to 
abnormal growth and does not imply precancerous lesions, as it does in other tissues ( Chapter 5). They 
number well over 350, and only select examples are discussed here.

- Other genetic metabolic disorders not usually thought 
of as primary skeletal diseases (e.g., mucopolysacchari-doses such as Hurler syndrome) also affect the bone matrix; such conditions are discussed briefly with other genetic disorders in Chapter 6. Osteogenesis Imperfecta
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as “brittle bone disease,” is actually a group of genetic disorders caused by defec -
tive synthesis of type I collagen.

Because type I collagen is a 
major component of extracellular matrix in other parts of the body, there are also numerous extraskeletal manifesta -
tions (affecting skin, joints, teeth, and eyes, for example). The mutations underlying OI characteristically involve the coding sequences for α
1 or α2 chains of type I collagen.

Because collagen synthesis and extracellular export require formation of a complete and intact triple helix, any primary defect in a collagen chain tends to disrupt the entire 
structure and results in its premature degradation (an example of a dominant negative mutation) (Chapter 6). As a 
consequence, most defects manifest as autosomal domi -
nant disorders and may be associated with severe 
malformations.

There is, however, a broad spectrum of severity, and mutations that result in qualitatively normal

vitamin C (involved in collagen cross-linking; deficiency 
causes scurvy) and vitamin D (involved in calcium uptake; 
deficiency causes rickets and osteomalacia). Both of these are 
discussed in greater detail with other nutritional diseases in Chapter 7 . Primary and secondary forms of hyperpara -
thyroidism (discussed in Chapter 19) also cause significant 
skeletal changes, which are briefly reviewed in this section.

Many of these disorders are characterized by inadequate osteoid, also called osteopenia; the most important clinically 
significant osteopenia is osteoporosis. Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is an acquired condition characterized by reduced bone mass, leading to bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures. The bone loss may be confined to certain bones or regions, as in disuse osteoporosis of a limb, or be general-
ized, involving the entire skeleton.

Generalized osteoporo -
sis may be primary or occur secondary to a large variety of insults, including metabolic diseases, vitamin deficiencies, and drug exposures (Table 20–1). Primary forms of osteoporosis are most common and 
may be associated with aging (senile osteoporosis) or the postmenopausal state in women. The drop in estrogen fol -
lowing menopause tends to exacerbate the loss of bone that occurs with aging, placing older women at high risk of osteoporosis relative to men.

The risk of osteoporosis with aging is related to the peak bone mass earlier in life, which is influenced by genetic, nutritional, and environmental factors. Bone mass peaks during young adulthood; the greater the peak bone mass, the greater the delay in onset of osteoporosis. In both men and women, beginning in the third or fourth decade of life, bone resorption begins to outpace bone formation.

The bone loss, averaging 0.5% per year, is a seemingly inevitable consequence of aging and is most prominent in areas containing abundant trabecular bone—namely the spine and femoral neck. The amount of bone loss with each cycle of remodeling is accelerated after menopause; hence, the vulnerability of women to osteopo -
rosis and its complications.

Regardless of the underlying cause, the progressive loss of bone mass is clinically signifi -
cant because of the resultant increase in the risk of frac -
tures. Roughly 1.5 million Americans each year experience an osteoporosis-related fracture, with those of greatest clinical significance involving the vertebrae and the hips.

All told, the annual health care costs associated with osteo -
porosis-related fractures in the United States exceeds $18 billion.precise nature of the osteoclast dysfunction is unknown in many cases. Nevertheless, in some cases the abnormalities have been identified. These include carbonic anhydrase II deficiency, proton pump deficiency and chloride channel defect, all of which interfere with the ability of osteoclasts to resorb bone.

A mouse model of osteopetrosis is caused by mutations in the monocyte-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), which is required for osteoclast differentiation. No comparable defect has been identified in humans.

Besides fractures, patients with osteopetrosis frequently 
have cranial nerve palsies (due to compression of nerves within shrunken cranial foramina), recurrent infections because of reduced marrow size and activity, and hepato -
splenomegaly caused by extramedullary hematopoiesis resulting from reduced marrow space.

Morphologically, the primary spongiosa, which normally is removed during growth, persists, filling the medullary cavity, and bone is deposited in increased amounts woven into the architec -
ture. Because osteoclasts are derived from marrow mono-cyte precursors, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation holds the promise of repopulating recipients with progeni -
tor cells capable of differentiating into fully functional osteoclasts.

Indeed, many of the skeletal abnormalities appear to be reversible once normal precursor cells are provided. SUMMARY
Congenital Disorders of Bone and Cartilage
- Abnormalities in a single or group of bones are called 
dysostoses and can result in the absence of bones, super -
numerary bones, or inappropriately fused bones; some of these result from mutations in homeobox genes affecting localized migration and condensation of primitive mesen -
chymal cells.

- Abnormalities in bone or cartilage organogenesis are 
called dysplasias; these can be caused by mutations that 
affect signal transduction pathways or components of the extracellular matrix:
 Achondroplasia and thanatophoric dwarfism occur as a 
consequence of constitutive FGFR3 activation, resulting in defective cartilage synthesis at growth plates.

 Osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) is a 
group of disorders caused by mutations in the genes for type 1 collagen that interfere with its normal pro -
duction, with resultant bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures.  Osteopetrosis is caused by mutations that interfere 
with osteoclast function and is associated with dense but architecturally unsound bone owing to defective bone resorption. MORPHOLOGY
The hallmark of osteoporosis is a loss of bone.

The cortices are thinned, with dilated haversian canals, and the trabeculae are reduced in thickness and lose their interconnections. Osteoclastic activity is present but is not dramatically increased, and the mineral content of the bone tissue is normal. Once enough bone is lost, susceptibility to fractures increases (Fig. 20–3).

In postmenopausal osteoporosis, tra -
becular bone loss often is severe, resulting in compression

rosis, cortical bone loss is prominent, predisposing to frac -
tures in other weight-bearing bones, such as the femoral 
neck. PATHOGENESIS
Osteoporosis occurs when the dynamic balance between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts (Fig. 20–2) tilts in favor of resorption.

Several factors may tip the scales (Fig. 20–4):
- Age-related  changes. With increasing age, the replica -
tive and matrix production activities of osteoblasts 
progressively diminish. The various growth factors depos -
ited in the extracellular matrix also diminish with time. Unfortunately, while new bone synthesis wanes with advancing age, osteoclasts retain their youthful vigor.

rosis (see text).

• Hormonal  influences. The decline in estrogen levels 
associated with menopause correlates with an accelera-
tion of cortical bone and trabecular (cancellous) bone loss. Over 30 to 40 years, this can result in the loss of up to 35% of cortical bone and 50% of trabecular bone! It is therefore not surprising that roughly half of postmeno -
pausal women will suffer an osteoporotic fracture 
(compared with 2% to 3% of men of comparable age).

It appears that the postmenopausal drop in estrogen leads to increased cytokine production (especially IL-1, IL-6, 
and TNF), presumably from cells in the bone. These stim -
ulate RANK–RANK ligand activity and suppress OPG production (Fig. 20–2). There is some compensatory osteoblastic activity, but it is inadequate to keep pace 
with osteoclastic bone resorption.

While estrogen replace -
ment can ameliorate some of the bone loss, such therapy is increasingly associated with cardiovascular risks 
(Chapter 10).

Clinical Course
The clinical outcome with osteoporosis depends on which 
bones are involved. Thoracic and lumbar vertebral frac -
tures are extremely common, leading to loss of height and various deformities, including kyphoscoliosis, which can compromise respiratory function. Pulmonary embolism and pneumonia are common complications of fractures of the femoral neck, pelvis, or spine and result in as many as 50,000 deaths annually.

Osteoporosis is difficult to diagnose because it is asymp -
tomatic until skeletal fragility is announced with a fracture. Moreover, it cannot be reliably detected in plain radio-graphs until 30% to 40% of bone mass has already disap -
peared; serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase are notoriously insensitive.

Current state-of-the-art methods for bone loss estimation consist of special -
ized radiographic techniques to assess bone mineral density, such as dual-energy absorptiometry and quantita -
tive computed tomography. Osteoporosis prevention and treatment begin with ade -
quate dietary calcium intake, vitamin D supplementation, and a regular exercise regimen—starting before the age of 30—to maximize the peak bone mass.

Calcium and vitamin D supplements later in life can also modestly reduce bone loss. Pharmacologic treatments include use of antiresorp -
tive and osteoanabolic agents. The antiresorptive agents, such as bisphosphonates, calcitonin, estrogen, and deno -
sumab, decrease bone resorption by osteoclasts. The main anabolic agent is parathyroid hormone or an analogue, given in amounts that stimulate osteoblastic activity.

MORPHOLOGY
Paget disease may manifest as a solitary lesion (monostotic) or may occur at multiple sites (polyostotic) usually asynchro -
nously. In the initial 
lytic phase, osteoclasts (and their asso -
ciated Howship lacunae) are numerous, abnormally large, and have increased numbers of nuclei. Osteoclasts persist in the 
mixed  phase, but the bone surfaces become lined by 
prominent osteoblasts.

The marrow is replaced by loose connective tissue containing osteoprogenitor cells, as well as numerous blood vessels needed to meet the increased meta -
bolic demands of the tissue. The newly formed bone may be woven or lamellar, but eventually all of it is remodeled into abnormal lamellar bone with a pathognomonic 
mosaic  
pattern (likened to a jigsaw puzzle) due to prominent hap -
hazardly arranged cement lines ( Fig. 20–5).

As the osteoblas-
tic activity ceases, the periosseous fibrovascular tissue recedes and is replaced by normal marrow. Although thickened, the resulting cortex is softer than normal and prone to deforma -
tion and fracture under stress. - Physical  activity. Because mechanical forces stimulate 
bone remodeling, reduced physical activity increases bone loss. This effect is obvious in an immobilized limb and also occurs throughout the skeleton in astronauts working in a gravity-free environment.

Decreased physical activity in older persons also contributes to senile osteoporosis. Because the magnitude of skeletal loading influences bone density more than does the number of load cycles, the type of physical activity is important. Thus, resistance exercises such as weight training increase bone mass more effectively than endurance activities such as jogging. - Genetic  factors. Vitamin D receptor polymorphisms 
appear to influence the peak bone mass early in life.

Addi -
tional genetic variables can influence either calcium uptake or PTH synthesis and responses. - Calcium  nutritional  state. A majority of adolescent 
girls (but not boys) have insufficient dietary calcium. Unfortunately, this calcium deficiency occurs during a period of rapid bone growth.

As a result, girls typically do not achieve the peak bone mass that could be otherwise expected and are accordingly more likely to develop clini -
cally significant osteoporosis at an earlier age than their male counterparts. - Secondary  causes  of osteoporosis. These include 
prolonged glucocorticoid therapy, which increases 
bone resorption and reduces bone synthesis. Cigarette smoking and excess alcohol also can result in reduced bone mass.

Paget Disease (Osteitis Deformans)
This unique skeletal disease is characterized by repetitive episodes of frenzied, regional osteoclastic activity and bone resorption (osteolytic stage), followed by exuberant bone formation ( mixed osteoclastic-osteoblastic stage), and finally 
by an apparent exhaustion of cellular activity (osteosclerotic stage).

The net effect of this process is a gain in bone mass; 
however, the newly formed bone is disordered and weak, so bones may become enlarged and misshapen. Paget disease usually presents in mid- to late adulthood. Marked variation in prevalence has been reported in dif-ferent populations: The disorder is rare in Scandinavia, China, Japan, and Africa and relatively common in 
much of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, affecting up to 2.5% of the adult populations.

Of interest, it appears that the incidence of Paget disease is decreasing. Figure  20–5 Paget disease, showing a mosaic pattern of lamellar bone.

771 Acquired Diseases of Bone
poor, but otherwise Paget disease usually follows a 
relatively benign course. Most patients have mild symp -
toms that are readily controlled with bisphosphonates, 
drugs that interfere with bone resorption. Rickets and Osteomalacia
Both rickets and osteomalacia are manifestations of 
vitamin D deficiency or its abnormal metabolism (and 
are detailed in Chapter 7).

The fundamental defect is 
an impairment of mineralization and a resultant accumula -
tion of unmineralized matrix. This contrasts with osteopo -
rosis, in which the mineral content of the bone is normal and the total bone mass is decreased. Rickets refers to 
the disorder in children, in which it interferes with the deposition of bone in the growth plates.

Osteomalacia is the 
adult counterpart, in which bone formed during remodel -
ing is undermineralized, resulting in predisposition to fractures. Hyperparathyroidism
As discussed in Chapter 19, parathyroid hormone (PTH) 
plays a central role in calcium homeostasis through the following effects:
- Osteoclast activation, increasing bone resorption and 
calcium mobilization. PTH mediates the effect indirectly by increased RANKL expression on osteoblasts.

- Increased resorption of calcium by the renal tubules
- Increased urinary excretion of phosphates
- Increased synthesis of active vitamin D, 1,25(OH) 2-D, by 
the kidneys, which in turn enhances calcium absorption from the gut and mobilizes bone calcium by inducing RANKL on osteoblasts
The net result of the actions of PTH is an elevation in serum calcium, which, under normal circumstances, inhibits further PTH production.

However, excessive or inappro -
priate levels of PTH can result from autonomous parathy -
roid secretion ( primary hyperparathyroidism) or can occur in 
the setting of underlying renal disease ( secondary hyperpara -
thyroidism) (see also Chapter 19). In either setting, hyperparathyroidism leads to significant 
skeletal changes related to unabated osteoclast activity. The entire skeleton is affected, although some sites can be 
more severely affected than others.

PTH is directly respon -
sible for the bone changes seen in primary hyperpara -
thyroidism, but additional influences contribute to the 
development of bone disease in secondary hyperpara -
thyroidism. In chronic renal insufficiency there is inade -
quate 1,25-(OH) 2-D synthesis, which ultimately affects 
gastrointestinal calcium absorption.

The hyperphos -
phatemia of renal failure also suppresses renal α1-
hydroxylase, further impairing vitamin D synthesis; additional influences include metabolic acidosis and 
aluminum deposition in bone. As bone mass decreases, affected patients are increasingly susceptible to fractures, bone deformation, and joint problems. Fortunately, a reduction in PTH levels to normal can completely reverse the bone changes. Clinical Course
The clinical findings depend on the extent and site of the disease.

Paget disease is monostotic (tibia, ilium, femur, 
skull, vertebrae, and humerus) in about 15% of cases and polyostotic in the remainder; the axial skeleton or the proxi-mal femur is involved in as many as 80% of cases. Involve -
ment of the ribs, fibulae, and small bones of the hands and feet is unusual.

Although Paget disease can produce a plethora of skeletal, neuromuscular, and cardiovascular complications, most cases are clinically mild, and the bone changes are discovered only incidentally in radiographs. Elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase and increased urinary excretion of hydroxyproline reflect exuberant bone turnover. In some patients, the early hypervascular bone lesions 
cause warmth of the overlying skin and subcutaneous tissue.

With extensive polyostotic disease, hypervascular -
ity can result in high-output congestive heart failure. In the proliferative phase of the disease involving the skull, common symptoms attributable to nerve impingement include headache and visual and auditory disturbances. Vertebral lesions cause back pain and may be associated with disabling fractures and nerve root compression.

Affected long bones in the legs often are deformed, as a consequence of the inability of pagetoid bone to remodel appropriately in response to the stress of weight bearing. Brittle long bones in particular are subject to chalkstick 
fractures. The development of sarcoma is a dreaded but fortu -
nately rare complication of Paget disease, occurring in only an estimated 1% of patients. The sarcomas usually are osteogenic, although other histologic variants can occur.

The dis tribution of osteosarcoma generally parallels that of 
the Paget disease lesions, with the exception of vertebral bodies, which rarely harbor malignancy. The prognosis for patients who develop secondary sarcomas is exceedingly PATHOGENESIS
When he first described the disease, Sir James Paget attrib -
uted the skeletal changes to an inflammatory process, and assigned the moniker 
osteitis  deformans.

After many 
years and multiple alternative theories, Paget’s original idea may prove to be correct. It has long been postulated that a paramyxovirus infection (a slow virus) underlies Paget disease. Paramyxovirus antigens and particles resembling paramyxovirus can be demonstrated in osteoclasts.

The causal connection is that paramyxoviruses can induce IL-1 and IL-6 secretion from infected cells, and these cytokines—as well as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)—are produced in large amounts in pagetic bone. As noted earlier, these potently activate osteoclasts. Nevertheless, as intriguing as these observations are, no infectious virus has been isolated from affected tissue.

About 10% of affected patients have germline mutations in the gene SQSTM1, which encodes a protein that appears to increase osteoclastogen -
esis; these mutations are associated with earlier onset disease, a greater number of affected bones, and an increased inci -
dence of fractures.

SUMMARY
Acquired Diseases of Bone Development and Mass
- Nutritional deficiencies can aff ect bone integrity by 
altering the quality of the organic matrix (e.g., vitamin 
C is involved in collagen cross-linking) or by influencing 
bone mineralization (e.g., vitamin D is involved in calcium uptake). - Osteoporosis results from decreased bone mass and is 
clinically significant because it predisposes bone to frac -
ture.

Although osteoporosis is multifactorial, the two most common forms are senile osteoporosis due to aging-
related losses of osteoblast function, and postmenopausal 
osteoporosis due to increased osteoclastic activity caused by the relative absence of estrogen. - Paget disease may result from a paramyxovirus infection 
in genetically susceptible persons and is caused by 
aberrant and excessive osteoclast activity, followed by exuberant—but structurally unsound—osteoblast depo -
sition of bone.

- Primary or secondary (due to renal failure) overproduc -
tion of PTH ( hyperparathyroidism) results in increased 
osteoclast activity and bone resorption, leading to frac -
tures and deformities. A

clasts gnawing into and disrupting lamellar bone. B, Resected rib, with 
expansile cystic mass (so-called brown tumor). MORPHOLOGY
The hallmark of PTH excess is increased  osteoclastic  
activity,  with bone  resorption.

Cortical and trabecular 
bone are diminished and replaced by loose connective tissue. Bone resorption is especially pronounced in the subperiosteal regions and produces characteristic radiographic changes, best seen along the radial aspect of the middle phalanges of the second and third fingers. Microscopically, there are 
increased  numbers  of osteoclasts  boring  into the 
centers  of bony  trabeculae  (dissecting  osteitis)  and 
expanding  haversian  canals  (cortical  cutting  cones) 
(Fig.

20–6, A). The marrow space contains increased amounts 
of loose fibrovascular tissue. Hemosiderin deposits are present, reflecting episodes of hemorrhage resulting from microfractures of the weakened bone. In some instances, collections of osteoclasts, reactive giant cells, and hemor-rhagic debris form a distinct mass termed a 
brown  tumor  
of hyperparathyroidism (Fig. 20–6, B).

Cystic change is 
common in such lesions (hence the name osteitis  fibrosa  
cystica), which can be confused with primary bone neoplasms. FRACTURES
Fractures rank among the most common pathologic condi-tions of bone.

They are classified as follows:
- Complete or incomplete
- Closed, in which the overlying tissue is intact, or com-
pound, in which the fracture extends into the overlying skin
- Comminuted, in which the bone is splintered
- Displaced, in which the fractured bone is not aligned
If the break occurs at the site of previous disease (e.g., 
a bone cyst, a malignant tumor, or a brown tumor 
associated with elevated PTH), it is termed a pathologic 
fracture.

A stress fracture develops slowly over time as a 
collection of microfractures associated with increased physical activity, especially with new repetitive mechani -
cal loads on bone (as sustained in military bootcamp activities).

In all cases, the repair of a fracture is a highly regulated 
process that involves overlapping stages:
- The trauma of the bone fracture ruptures associated 
blood vessels; the resulting blood clot creates a fibrin mesh scaffold to recruit inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and endothelium.

Degranulated platelets and maraud -
ing inflammatory cells subsequently release a host of cytokines (e.g., platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor) that activate bone progenitor cells, and within a week, the involved tissue is primed for new matrix synthesis. This soft tissue callus can hold the ends 
of the fractured bone in apposition but is noncalcified and cannot support weight bearing.

- Bone progenitors in the periosteum and medullary 
cavity deposit new foci of woven bone, and activated

773 Osteomyelitis
- Thromboembolic disease (e.g., nitrogen bubbles in 
caisson disease—see Chapter 3)
- Primary vessel disease (e.g., vasculitis)
- Sickle cell crisis ( Chapter 11)
Most cases of bone necrosis are due to fracture or occur 
after corticosteroid use, but in many instances the etiology is unknown.mesenchymal cells at the fracture site differentiate into 
cartilage-synthesizing chondroblasts. In uncomplicated fractures, this early repair process peaks within 2 to 3 weeks.

The newly formed cartilage acts as a nidus for endochondral ossification, recapitulating the process of bone formation in epiphyseal growth plates. This con-nects the cortices and trabeculae in the juxtaposed bones. With ossification, the fractured ends are bridged by a bony callus.

- Although excess fibrous tissue, cartilage, and bone are 
produced in the early callus, subsequent weight bearing leads to remodeling of the callus from nonstressed sites; at the same time there is fortification of regions that support greater loads. This process restores the original size, shape, and integrity of the bone.

The healing of a fracture can be disrupted by many 
factors:
- Displaced and comminuted fractures frequently 
result in some deformity; devitalized fragments of splin -
tered bone require resorption, which delays healing, enlarges the callus, and requires inordinately long periods of remodeling and may never completely normalize. - Inadequate immobilization permits constant movement 
at the fracture site, so that the normal constituents of callus do not form.

In such instances, the healing site is composed mainly of fibrous tissue and cartilage, per -
petuating the instability and resulting in delayed union and nonunion. Too much motion along the fracture gap (as in nonunion) causes the central portion of the callus to undergo cystic degeneration; the luminal surface can actually become lined by synovial-type cells, creating a false joint, or pseudoarthrosis.

In the setting of a nonunion 
or pseudoarthrosis, normal healing can be achieved only if the interposed soft tissues are removed and the frac -
ture site is stabilized. - Infection (a risk in comminuted and open fractures) is a serious obstacle to fracture healing. The infection must be eradicated before successful bone reunion and remod -
eling can occur.

- Bone repair obviously will be impaired in the setting of 
inadequate levels of calcium or phosphorus, vitamin deficiencies, systemic infection, diabetes, or vascular insufficiency. With uncomplicated fractures in children and young adults, practically perfect reconstitution is the norm. When fractures occur in older age groups or in abnormal bones (e.g., osteoporotic bone), repair frequently is less than optimal without orthopedic intervention.

OSTEONECROSIS (AVASCULAR 
NECROSIS)
Ischemic necrosis with resultant bone infarction occurs 
relatively frequently. Mechanisms contributing to bone ischemia include
- Vascular compression or disruption (e.g., after a 
fracture)
- Steroid administration MORPHOLOGY
The pathologic features of bone necrosis are the same regardless of cause. Dead bone with empty lacunae is inter -
spersed with areas of fat necrosis and insoluble calcium soaps.

The cortex usually is not affected, because of collat -
eral blood supply; in subchondral infarcts, the overlying artic -
ular cartilage also remains viable because the synovial fluid can provide nutritive support. With time, osteoclasts can resorb some of the necrotic bony trabeculae; any dead bone fragments that remain act as scaffolding for new bone forma -
tion, a process called 
creeping  substitution. Clinical Course
Symptoms depend on the size and location of injury.

Sub-
chondral infarcts initially present with pain during physical activity that becomes more persistent with time. Medullary 
infarcts usually are silent unless large in size (as may occur with Gaucher disease, caisson disease, or sickle cell disease). Medullary infarcts usually are stable, but subchondral infarcts often collapse and may lead to severe osteoarthri -
tis. Roughly 50,000 joint replacements are performed each year in the United States to treat the consequences of osteonecrosis.

OSTEOMYELITIS
Osteomyelitis is defined as inflammation of bone and marrow, but in common use it is virtually synonymous with infection. Osteomyelitis can be secondary to systemic infection but more frequently occurs as a primary isolated focus of disease; it can be an acute process or a chronic, debilitating illness. Although any microorganism can cause osteomyelitis, the most common etiologic agents are pyo-genic bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Pyogenic Osteomyelitis
Most cases of acute osteomyelitis are caused by bacteria. The offending organisms reach the bone by one of three routes: (1) hematogenous dissemination (most common); (2) extension from an infection in adjacent joint or soft tissue; or (3) traumatic implantation after compound frac -
tures or orthopedic procedures.

Overall, Staphylococcus 
aureus is the most frequent causative organism; its propen -
sity to infect bone may be related to the expression of surface proteins that allow adhesion to bone matrix. Esch-
erichia coli and group B streptococci are important causes of acute osteomyelitis in neonates, and Salmonella is an 
especially common pathogen in persons with sickle cell

Clinical Features
Osteomyelitis classically manifests as an acute systemic 
illness, with malaise, fever, leukocytosis, and throbbing pain over the affected region. Symptoms also can be subtle, with only unexplained fever, particularly in infants, or 
only localized pain in the adult. The diagnosis is suggested by characteristic radiologic findings: a destructive lytic focus surrounded by edema and a sclerotic rim.

In many untreated cases, blood cultures are positive, but biopsy and bone cultures are usually required to identify the pathogen. A combination of antibiotics and surgical drainage usually is curative, but up to a quarter of cases do not resolve and persist as chronic infections. Chronicity may develop with delay in diagnosis, extensive bone necrosis, abbreviated antibiotic therapy, inadequate surgical debridement, and/or weakened host defenses.

Besides occasional acute flare -
ups, chronic osteomyelitis also may be complicated by pathologic fracture, secondary amyloidosis, endocarditis, sepsis, development of squamous cell carcinoma if the infection creates a sinus tract, and rarely osteosarcoma.

T uberculous Osteomyelitis
Mycobacterial infection of bone has long been a problem in developing countries; with the resurgence of tuberculo -
sis (due to immigration patterns and increasing numbers of immunocompromised persons) it is becoming an impor-tant disease in other countries as well. Bone infection complicates an estimated 1% to 3% of 
cases of pulmonary tuberculosis.

The organisms usually reach the bone through the bloodstream, although direct spread from a contiguous focus of infection (e.g., from mediastinal nodes to the vertebrae) also can occur. With hematogenous spread, long bones and vertebrae are favored 
sites. The lesions often are solitary but can be multifocal, particularly in patients with an underlying immunodefi -
ciency.

Because the tubercle bacillus is microaerophilic, the synovium, with its higher oxygen pressures, is a common site of initial infection. The infection then spreads to the adjacent epiphysis, where it elicits typical granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis and extensive bone destruction. Tuberculosis of the vertebral bodies is a clinically 
serious form of osteomyelitis.

Infection at this site causes ver -
tebral deformity, collapse, and posterior displacement (Pott disease), leading to neurologic deficits. Spinal defor -
mities due to Pott disease afflicted several men of letters (including Alexander Pope and William Henley) and likely served as the inspiration for Victor Hugo’s Hunchback of 
Notre Dame. Extension of the infection to the adjacent soft tissues with the development of psoas muscle abscesses is fairly common.

BONE TUMORS
Primary bone tumors are considerably less common than bone metastases from other primary sites; metastatic disease is discussed at the end of this section. Primary bone tumors exhibit great morphologic diversity and 
clinical behaviors—from benign to aggressively malignant.

Most 
are classified according to the normal cell counterpart and line of differentiation; Table 20–2 lists the salient features MORPHOLOGY
The morphologic changes in osteomyelitis depend on the chronicity and location of the infection. Causal bacteria pro -
liferate, inducing an acute inflammatory reaction, with conse -
quent cell death. Entrapped bone rapidly becomes necrotic; this non-viable bone is called a sequestrum.

Bacteria and 
inflammation can percolate throughout the haversian systems to reach the periosteum. In children, the periosteum is loosely attached to the cortex; therefore, sizable subperi-
osteal abscesses can form and extend for long distances along the bone surface. Lifting of the periosteum further impairs the blood supply to the affected region, and both suppurative and ischemic injury can cause segmental bone necrosis.

Rupture of the periosteum can lead to abscess formation in the surrounding soft tissue that may lead to a 
draining  sinus. Sometimes the sequestrum crumbles, 
releasing fragments that pass through the sinus tract. In infants (and uncommonly in adults), epiphyseal infection 
can spread into the adjoining joint to produce suppurative arthritis, sometimes with extensive destruction of the articu -
lar cartilage and permanent disability.

An analogous process can involve vertebrae, with an infection destroying interver -
tebral discs and spreading into adjacent vertebrae. After the first week of infection, chronic inflammatory cells 
become more numerous. Leukocyte cytokine release stimu -
lates osteoclastic bone resorption, fibrous tissue ingrowth, and bone formation in the periphery. Reactive woven or lamellar bone can be deposited; when it forms a shell of living tissue around a sequestrum, it is called an involucrum (Fig. 20–7).

Viable organisms can persist in the sequestrum for years after the original infection. Figure  20–7 Resected femur from a patient with chronic osteomyelitis. Necrotic bone (the sequestrum) visible in the center of a draining sinus 
tract is surrounded by a rim of new bone (the involucrum). disease. Mixed bacterial infections, including anaerobes, 
typically are responsible for osteomyelitis secondary to bone trauma. In as many as 50% of cases, no organisms can be isolated.

of the most common primary bone neoplasms, excluding 
multiple myeloma and other hematopoietic tumors.

Overall, matrix-producing and fibrous tumors are the most common, and among the benign tumors, osteochondroma and fibrous cortical defect occur most frequently. Osteosar -
coma is the most common primary bone cancer, followed by chondrosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Benign tumors greatly outnumber their malignant counterparts, particu -
larly before the age of 40 years; bone tumors in elderly persons are much more likely to be malignant.

Most bone tumors develop during the first several 
decades of life and have a propensity to originate in the long bones of the extremities. Nevertheless, specific tumor types target certain age groups and anatomic sites; these associations are often helpful in arriving at the correct diag -
nosis. For instance, most osteosarcomas occur during ado -
lescence, with half arising around the knee, either in the distal femur or proximal tibia.

By contrast, chondrosarco -
mas tend to develop during mid- to late adulthood 
and involve the trunk, limb girdles, and proximal long bones. Most bone tumors arise without any previous known 
cause. Nevertheless, genetic syndromes (e.g., Li-Fraumeni and retinoblastoma syndromes) ( Chapter 5) are associated 
with osteosarcomas, as are (rarely) bone infarcts, chronic osteomyelitis, Paget disease, irradiation, and use of metal orthopedic devices.

In terms of clinical presentation, benign lesions fre -
quently are asymptomatic and are detected as incidental findings. Others produce pain or a slowly growing mass. Occasionally, a pathologic fracture is the first manifesta -
tion. Radiologic imaging is critical in the evaluation of bone tumors; however, biopsy and histologic study and, in some cases, molecular tests are necessary for diagnosis.

Bone-Forming T umors
The tumor cells in the following neoplasms all produce bone that usually is woven and variably mineralized. Osteoma
Osteomas are benign lesions most commonly encountered in the head and neck, including the paranasal sinuses, but which can occur elsewhere as well. They typically present in middle age as solitary, slowly growing, hard, exophytic

Osteosarcoma
Osteosarcoma is a bone-producing malignant mesenchymal 
tumor. After myeloma and lymphoma, osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone, account-ing for approximately 20% of primary bone cancers; a little over 2000 cases are diagnosed annually in the United States.

Osteosarcomas occur in all age groups, but about 75% of patients are younger than 20 years of age, with a second peak occurring in elderly persons, usually in asso -
ciation with other conditions, including Paget disease, bone infarcts, and previous irradiation. Men are more com -
monly affected than women (1.6 : 1).

Although any bone 
can be involved, most tumors arise in the metaphyseal region of the long bones of the extremities, with almost 60% occurring about the knee, 15% around the hip, 10% at the shoulder, and 8% in the jaw.

Several subtypes of osteosar -
coma are distinguished on the basis of the site of involve -
ment within the bone (e.g., medullary versus cortical), degree of differentiation, number of involved sites, pres -
ence of underlying disease, and histologic features; the most common type of osteosarcoma is primary, solitary, intramedullary, and poorly differentiated, producing a predominantly bony matrix.masses on a bone surface.

Multiple lesions are a feature of Gardner syndrome, a hereditary condition discussed later. On histologic examination, osteomas recapitulate cortical-type bone and are composed of a mixture of woven and lamellar bone. Although they may cause local mechanical problems (e.g., obstruction of a sinus cavity) and cosmetic deformities, they are not locally aggressive and do not undergo malignant transformation.

Osteoid Osteoma and Osteoblastoma
Osteoid osteomas and osteoblastomas are benign neoplasms 
with very similar histologic features. Both lesions typically appear during the teenage years and 20s, with a male pre-
dilection (2 : 1 for osteoid osteomas). They are distinguished 
from each other primarily by their size and clinical presen -
tation.

Osteoid osteomas arise most often beneath the peri -
osteum or within the cortex in the proximal femur and tibia or posterior spinal elements and are by definition less than 
2 cm in diameter, whereas osteoblastomas are larger. Localized pain, most severe at night, is an almost universal complaint with osteoid osteomas, and usually is relieved by aspirin.

Osteoblastomas arise most often in the vertebral 
column; they also cause pain, although it often is more dif -
ficult to localize and is not responsive to aspirin. Local excision is the treatment of choice; incompletely resected lesions can recur. Malignant transformation is rare unless 
the lesion is treated with irradiation. MORPHOLOGY
On gross evaluation, osteosarcomas are gritty-appearing, gray-white tumors, often exhibiting hemorrhage and cystic degeneration.

Tumors frequently destroy the surrounding cortices, producing soft tissue masses ( Fig. 20–9, A). They 
spread extensively in the medullary canal, infiltrating and replacing the marrow but only infrequently penetrating the epiphyseal plate or entering the joint space. Tumor cells vary in size and shape and frequently have large hyperchromatic 
MORPHOLOGY
On gross inspection, both lesions are round-to-oval masses of hemorrhagic, gritty-appearing tan tissue.

A rim of sclerotic bone is present at the edge of both types of tumors; however, it is much more conspicuous in osteoid osteomas. On micro -
scopic examination, both neoplasms are composed of inter -
lacing trabeculae of woven bone surrounded by osteoblasts (Fig. 20–8). The intervening stroma is loose, vascular connec -
tive tissue containing variable numbers of giant cells. Figure  20–8 Osteoid osteoma showing randomly oriented trabeculae

nuclei; bizarre tumor giant cells are common, as are mitotic 
figures. The production  of mineralized  or unmineral -
ized bone  (osteoid)  by malignant  cells is essential  for 
diagnosis  of osteosarcoma (Fig. 20–9, B). The neoplastic 
bone typically is coarse and lacelike but also can be deposited in broad sheets. Cartilage and fibroblastic differentiation can also be present in varying amounts.

When malignant cartilage is abundant, the tumor is called a 
chondroblastic  osteo -
sarcoma. Vascular invasion is common, as is spontaneous tumor necrosis. PATHOGENESIS
Several mutations are closely associated with the develop -
ment of osteosarcoma. In particular, RB gene mutations 
occur in 60% to 70% of sporadic tumors, and persons with hereditary retinoblastomas (due to germline mutations in the RB gene) have a thousand-fold greater risk for development of osteosarcoma.

Like many other cancers, spontaneous osteosarcomas also frequently exhibit mutations in TP53 and 
in genes that regulate the cell cycle, including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and kinase inhibitors. Many osteosarco -
mas develop at sites of greatest bone growth, perhaps because rapidly dividing cells provide a fertile soil for mutations. Clinical Features
Osteosarcomas typically manifest as painful enlarging masses, although a pathologic fracture can be the first sign.

Radiographic imaging usually shows a large, destructive, mixed lytic and blastic mass with indistinct infiltrating margins. The tumor frequently breaks through the cortex and lifts the periosteum, resulting in reactive periosteal bone formation. A triangular shadow on the x-ray film between the cortex and raised periosteum (Codman triangle) is characteristic of osteosarcomas.

Osteosarcomas typically spread hematogenously; at the time of diagnosis, approxi -
mately 10% to 20% of patients have demonstrable pulmo -
nary metastases, and a larger number have microscopic metastases. Despite aggressive behavior, standard treatment with 
chemotherapy and limb salvage therapy currently yields long-term survivals of 60% to 70%. Secondary osteosarcomas occur in older adults most 
commonly in the setting of Paget disease or previous radia -
tion exposure.

Like primary osteosarcomas, secondary osteosarcomas are highly aggressive tumors, but they do not respond well to therapy and are usually fatal. Cartilage-Forming T umors
Cartilage-forming tumors produce hyaline or myxoid car -
tilage; fibrocartilage and elastic cartilage are rare compo -
nents.

Like the bone-forming tumors, cartilaginous tumors constitute a spectrum from benign, self-limited growths to highly aggressive malignancies; again, benign cartilage tumors are much more common than malignant ones. Only the more common types are discussed here. Osteochondroma
Osteochondromas are relatively common benign, cartilage-capped tumors attached by a bony stalk to the underlying skeleton.

Solitary osteochondromas typically are first diag -
nosed in late adolescence and early adulthood (male-to-
female ratio of 3 : 1); multiple osteochondromas become 
apparent during childhood, occurring as multiple hereditary osteochondromas, an autosomal dominant disorder. Inacti-vation of both copies of the EXT1 or EXT2 genes through 
mutation and loss of heterozygosity in chondrocytes of the growth plate is implicated in both sporadic and hereditary osteochondromas.

These tumor suppressor genes encode glycosyltransferases essential for polymerization of heparin sulfate, an important component of cartilage. This finding and other molecular genetic studies support the concept that osteochondromas are true neoplasms and not devel -
opmental malformations.

Osteochondromas develop only in bones of endochon -
dral origin arising at the metaphysis near the growth plate of long tubular bones, especially about the knee; they tend to stop growing once the normal growth of the skeleton is completed (Fig. 20–10). Occasionally they develop from bones of the pelvis, scapula, and ribs and in these sites frequently are sessile. Rarely, osteochondromas arise in the short tubular bones of hands and feet.

Clinical Features
Osteochondromas are slow-growing masses that can be 
painful if they impinge on a nerve or if the stalk is 
fractured. In many cases, they are incidental findings. In multiple hereditary osteochondromas, deformity of the underlying bone suggests an associated disturbance in 
epiphyseal growth.

Solitary osteochondromas rarely pro -
gress to chondrosarcoma or other sarcomas, but malignant transformation occurs more frequently in those with mul -
tiple hereditary osteochondromas. Chondroma
Chondromas are benign neoplasms of hyaline cartilage. When they arise within the medulla, they are termed enchondromas; when on the bone surface, they are called juxtacortical chondromas.

Enchondromas usually are diag -
nosed in persons between the ages of 20 and 50 years; 
they typically are solitary and located in the metaphyseal region of tubular bones, the favored sites being the short tubular bones of the hands and feet. Ollier disease is char-
acterized by multiple chondromas preferentially involving 
one side of the body, and Maffucci syndrome is characterized 
by multiple chondromas associated with soft tissue spindle cell 
hemangiomas.

Clinical Features
Most enchondromas are detected as incidental findings; occasionally they are painful or cause pathologic fractures. On x-ray imaging, the unmineralized nodules of cartilage produce well-circumscribed oval lucencies surrounded by thin rims of radiodense bone ( O-ring sign). Calcified matrix 
manifests as irregular opacities. The growth potential of chondromas is limited, and most remain stable, although they can recur if incompletely excised.

Solitary chondro -
mas rarely undergo malignant transformation, but those associated with enchondromatoses are at increased risk for such change. Maffucci syndrome is associated with an increased risk for development of other types of malignan -
cies, including ovarian carcinomas and brain gliomas. Chondrosarcoma
Chondrosarcoma is a malignant connective tissue tumor (sarcoma) whose cells manufacture and secrete neoplastic cartilage matrix.

It is subclassified according to site (e.g., intramedullary versus juxtacortical) and histologic variants 
(discussed next). Chondrosarcomas occur roughly half as frequently as osteosarcomas; most patients are age 40 or older, with men affected twice as frequently as women. MORPHOLOGY
Osteochondromas range from 1 to 20 cm in size and have a 
cartilaginous cap that is usually less than 2 cm in thickness.

The hyaline cartilage resembles a disorganized growth plate undergoing endochondral ossification. Newly formed bone forms the inner portion of the head and stalk, with the stalk cortex and central region merging with the cortex and medul -
lary cavity, respectively, of the host bone. MORPHOLOGY
Conventional  chondrosarcoma,  the most  common  
variant, arises within the medullary cavity of the bone to form an expansile glistening mass that often erodes the cortex (Fig. 20–11, A).

It is composed of malignant hyaline 
and myxoid cartilage. Myxoid  chondrosarcomas are 
viscous and gelatinous in consistency, and the matrix oozes from the cut surface. The adjacent cortex is thickened or eroded, and the tumor grows with broad pushing fronts into marrow spaces and the surrounding soft tissue. Tumor grade is determined by cellularity, degree of cytologic atypia, and mitotic activity ( Fig. 20–11, B). Low-grade tumors may be 
difficult to distinguish from enchondroma.

Higher-grade lesions contain pleomorphic chondrocytes with frequent mitotic figures. Approximately 10% of patients with conventional low-
grade chondrosarcomas have a second high-grade poorly differentiated component 
(dedifferentiated  chondrosar -
comas) that includes foci of fibro- or osteosarcomas. Other histologic variants include 
clear  cell and mesenchymal  
chondrosarcomas. MORPHOLOGY
Enchondromas are gray-blue, translucent nodules usually 
smaller than 5 cm in gr eatest dimension.

On microscopic 
examination, they are well circumscribed and composed of hyaline cartilage containing cytologically benign chondro -
cytes. At the periphery, there is endochondral ossification, while the center frequently calcifies and dies. In the hereditary multiple chondromatoses, the islands of cartilage exhibit greater cellularity and atypia, making them more difficult to distinguish from chondrosarcoma.

PATHOGENESIS
Enchondromas occurring in Ollier disease and Maffucci syn -
drome frequently contain point mutations in either isocitrate dehydrogenase I (IDH1) or IDH2 that create a new enzyme activity. The same IDH mutations occur as somatic mutations in acute myeloid leukemias and gliomas, but in Ollier and Maffucci disease the mutations are also found at low fre-quency in normal tissues, suggesting the mutations occurred early during embryonic development, an example of genetic mosaicism.

Clinical Features
Chondrosarcomas commonly arise in the pelvis, shoulder, and ribs; in contrast with enchondromas, chondrosarcomas rarely involve the distal extremities. They typically mani -
fest as painful, progressively enlarging masses.

A slowly growing low-grade tumor causes reactive thickening of the cortex, whereas a more aggressive high-grade neoplasm destroys the cortex and forms a soft tissue mass; conse -
quently, the more radiolucent the tumor the greater the likelihood that it is high grade. There is also a direct cor -
relation between grade and biologic behavior of the tumor.

Fortunately, most conventional chondrosarcomas are indo-lent and low-grade, with a 5-year survival rate of 80% to 90% (versus 43% for grade 3 tumors); grade 1 tumors rarely

Clinical Features
Fibrous cortical defects are asymptomatic and typically 
are detected only as incidental radiographic lesions. The 
usual clinical course is characterized by spontaneous dif -
ferentiation into normal cortical bone within a few years, so as a rule, biopsy is not required. The few that enlarge into nonossifying fibromas can manifest with pathologic fracture; in such cases, biopsy is necessary to rule out other tumors.

Fibrous Dysplasia
Fibrous dysplasia is a benign tumor in which all compo -
nents of normal bone are present, but they fail to differenti -
ate into mature structures. Fibrous dysplasia manifests with one of three clinical patterns: (1) involvement of a single bone (monostotic); (2) involvement of multiple 
bones (polyostotic); and (3) polyostotic disease, associated with café au lait skin pigmentations and endocrine abnor -
malities, especially precocious puberty ( Mc Cune-Albright 
syndrome).

Mutations of the GNAS gene, resulting in a 
constitutively active G
s protein (Chapter 2), are responsible 
for all forms of fibrous dysplasia. The mutation occurs during embryogenesis (somatic mutations) resulting in mosaicism in the fetus and adult. The extent of manifesta -
tion (mono-ostotic, polyostotic, or Mc Cune-Albright syn-drome) depends on (1) the stage of embryogenesis when the mutation is acquired and (2) the fate of the cell harbor -
ing the initial mutation.

Monostotic fibrous dysplasia accounts for 70% of cases. The 
tumor usually arises during the second and third decades of life; there is no gender predilection. In descending order of frequency, ribs, femur, tibia, jawbones, calvariae, and humerus are most commonly affected. Lesions often are asymptomatic and frequently are discovered incidentally. However, fibrous dysplasia can cause marked enlargement

nate. Size is another prognostic feature, with tumors larger 
than 10 cm being significantly more aggressive than smaller 
tumors. Chondrosarcomas metastasize hematogenously, 
preferentially to the lungs and skeleton.

Conventional chondrosarcomas are treated with wide surgical excision; chemotherapy is added for the mesenchymal and dedif -
ferentiated variants because of their aggressive clinical course. Fibrous and Fibroosseous T umors
Fibrous tumors of the skeleton are extremely common and exhibit a wide diversity of morphologic variants. Fibrous Cortical Defect and Nonossifying Fibroma
Fibrous cortical defects are probably developmental abnor -
malities rather than true neoplasms.

The vast majority are 
smaller than 0.5 cm in diameter and arise eccentrically in 
the metaphysis of the distal femur or proximal tibia; almost 
50% are bilateral or multiple. Larger lesions (5 to 6 cm) 
develop into nonossifying fibromas. MORPHOLOGY
Fibrous cortical defects and nonossifying fibromas both mani -
fest as sharply demarcated radiolucencies surrounded by a thin zone of sclerosis.

On gross inspection, they are gray to yellow-brown; microscopic examination shows cellular 
lesions composed of cytologically benign fibroblasts and 
activated macrophages, including multinucleate forms. The fibroblasts classically exhibit a storiform (pinwheel) pattern (Fig. 20–12). Hemorrhage and hemosiderin deposits are a common finding. Figure  20–12 Fibrous cortical defect or nonossifying fibroma.

conservative surgery. Polyostotic involvement frequently 
is associated with progressive disease and more severe skeletal complications (e.g., fractures, long bone deformi -
ties, craniofacial distortion). Rarely, polyostotic disease can transform into osteosarcoma, especially after radiotherapy.

Miscellaneous Bone T umors
Ewing Sarcoma and Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor
Ewing sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) are primary malignant small round cell tumors of bone and soft tissue. They share certain molecular features (described below) and are best viewed as variants of the same tumor, differing only in degree of neuroectodermal differentiation and clinical features. PNETs demonstrate clear neural differentiation, whereas Ewing sarcomas are undifferentiated.

Ewing sarcoma accounts for 6% to 10% of primary 
malignant bone tumors. After osteosarcoma, it is the second most common pediatric bone sarcoma. Most patients are 10 to 15 years of age, and 80% are younger than 20 years. Boys are affected slightly more frequently than girls, and there is a striking racial predilection for whites; blacks and Asians are rarely afflicted.

The common chromosomal abnormality is a translocation that causes fusion of the EWS gene on 22q12 with a member of the ETS family of 
transcription factors. The most common fusion partners are the FL1 gene on 11q24 and the ERG gene on 21q22. The 
resulting chimeric protein functions as a transcription factor, but precisely how it contributes to oncogenesis remains uncertain; effects on differentiation, proliferation, and survival have all been proposed.

At a practical level, these translocations are of diagnostic importance, as approximately 95% of tumors have t(11;22)(q24;q12) or t(21;22)(q22;q12).and distortion of bone, so that if the face or skull is involved, disfigurement can occur, or it can cause pain and patho -
logic fracture. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia without endocrine dysfunction 
accounts for a majority of the remaining cases. It manifests at a slightly earlier age than that for the monostotic type.

In descending order of frequency, femur, skull, tibia, 
and humerus are most commonly involved. Craniofacial involvement is present in 50% of patients with moderate skeletal involvement and in 100% of patients with exten -
sive skeletal disease. Polyostotic disease tends to involve the shoulder and pelvic girdles, resulting in severe defor -
mities and spontaneous fractures. Mc Cune-Albright syndrome accounts for 3% of all cases.

The associated endocrinopathies include sexual precocity (girls more often than boys), hyperthyroidism, growth hormone–secreting pituitary adenomas, and primary adrenal hyperplasia. The severity of manifestations depends on the number and cell types that harbor the G protein mutation. The bone lesions may be unilateral, and the skin pigmentation usually is limited to the same side of the body.

The cutaneous macules classically are large, dark to light brown ( café au lait ), and irregular in 
configuration. MORPHOLOGY
On gross inspection, fibrous dysplasia is characterized by well-circumscribed, intramedullary lesions of varying sizes; large masses expand and distort the bone.

Lesional tissue is tan-white and gritty-appearing; on microscopic examination, it exhibits curved trabeculae of woven bone (mimicking Chinese characters), without osteoblastic rimming, sur -
rounded by a moderately cellular fibroblastic proliferation (Fig. 20–13). MORPHOLOGY
Ewing sarcoma/PNET arises in the medullary cavity and invades the cortex and periosteum to produce a soft tan-white tumor mass, frequently with hemorrhage and necrosis.

It is composed of sheets of uniform small, round cells that are slightly larger than lymphocytes; typically, there are few mitotic figures and little intervening stroma ( Fig. 20–14). The 
cells have scant glycogen-rich cytoplasm. The presence of 
Homer-Wright  rosettes (tumor cells circled about a 
central fibrillary space) indicates neural differentiation. Figure  20–13 Fibrous dysplasia. Curved trabeculae of woven bone 
arising in a fibrous tissue.

Note the absence of osteoblasts rimming the 
bones. Clinical Course
The natural history depends on the extent of skeletal 
involvement; patients with monostotic disease usually have minimal symptoms. On x-ray imaging, lesions exhibit a characteristic ground glass appearance with well-defined margins.

Symptomatic lesions are readily cured by 
Clinical Features
Ewing sarcoma/PNET typically manifests as a painful enlarging mass in the diaphyses of long tubular bones (especially the femur) and the pelvic flat bones. Some patients have systemic signs and symptoms suggestive of infection. Imaging studies show a destructive lytic tumor with infiltrative margins and extension into surrounding soft tissues. There is a characteristic periosteal reaction with deposition of bone in an onion-skin pattern.

Treatment includes chemotherapy and surgical excision 
with or without irradiation. The 5-year survival rate is cur -
rently 75% for patients presenting with localized tumors.

781 Bone Tumors
adults more than 75% of skeletal metastases originate from 
cancers of the prostate, breast, kidney, and lung. In chil -
dren, neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, osteosarcoma, Ewing 
sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma are the common sources of bony metastases. Most metastases involve the axial skeleton (vertebral 
column, pelvis, ribs, skull, sternum), proximal femur, and humerus, in descending order.

The red marrow in these areas, with its rich capillary network, slow blood flow, and nutrient environment rich in growth factors, facilitates tumor cell implantation and growth. The radiologic appearance of metastases can be purely 
lytic, purely blastic, or both.

In lytic lesions (e.g., with kidney and lung tumors and melanoma), the metastatic cells secrete substances such as prostaglandins, interleu-kins, and PTH-related protein (PTHr P) that stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption; the tumor cells themselves 
do not directly resorb bone. Similarly, metastatic tumors 
that elicit an osteoblastic response (e.g., prostate adeno -
carcinoma) do so by stimulating osteoblastic bone forma -
tion. Most metastases induce a mixed lytic and blastic reaction.

Giant Cell Tumor of Bone
Giant cell tumors (GCTs) contain prominent by multinucle -
ate osteoclast-type giant cells—hence the synonym osteo-
clastoma. GCT is a relatively common benign but locally aggressive bone tumor, usually arising in persons in their 20s to 40s. Despite the name, molecular analyses have shown that it is the mononuclear cells in the tumor that are 
neoplastic.

These cells may be related to osteoblast pre -
cursor cells, as they express RANK ligand, which may stimulate the development of surrounding non-neoplastic osteoclast-like cells. MORPHOLOGY
GCTs are large and red-brown, and often show cystic degen -
eration. They are composed of uniform oval mononuclear cells and scattered osteoclast-type giant cells containing 100 or more nuclei (Fig. 20–15). Mitotic figures are typically fre-quent.

Necrosis, hemorrhage, and reactive bone formation also are commonly present. Figure  20–14 Ewing sarcoma. Sheets of small round cells with scant, 
clear cytoplasm. Clinical Course
Although almost any bone may be involved, a majority of GCTs arise in the epiphysis and involve the metaphysis of long bones around the knee (distal femur and proximal tibia), frequently causing pain. Occasionally, GCTs mani-fest with pathologic fractures. Most are solitary tumors.

Radiographically, GCTs are large, purely lytic, and eccen -
tric; the overlying cortex frequently is destroyed, produc -
ing a bulging soft tissue mass with a thin shell of reactive bone. Although GCTs are considered benign, roughly half recur after simple curettage, and as many as 2% spread to the lungs as localized lesions that are cured by local excision. Metastatic Disease
Metastatic tumors are the most common malignant tumors involving bone.

Pathways of spread include (1) direct exten -
sion, (2) lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination, and (3) intraspinal seeding. Any cancer can spread to bone, but certain tumors exhibit a distinct skeletal predilection. In

giant cells and a background of mononuclear cells.

JOINTS
The joints are subject to a wide variety of disorders, includ -
ing degeneration, infections, immune-mediated injury, 
metabolic derangements, and neoplasms. Discussed in this section are the most common forms of arthritis—namely, osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease, select autoim -
mune arthritides, gout, and infectious arthritis—along with the two most common benign joint tumors.

ARTHRITIS
Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis, or degenerative joint disease, is the most 
common joint disorder. It is a frequent, if not inevitable, part of aging and is an important cause of physical 
disability in persons older than 65 years of age. The funda-
mental feature of osteoarthritis is degeneration of the articular cartilage; structural changes in the underlying bone are likely secondary.

Although the term osteoarthritis implies 
an inflammatory disease, osteoarthritis is primarily a degenerative disorder of articular cartilage in which the chondrocytes respond to biomechanical and biologic stresses in a way that results in breakdown of the matrix. In most cases, osteoarthritis appears insidiously with 
age and without apparent initiating cause ( primary osteoar-
thritis).

In such cases the disease usually is oligoarticular 
(i.e., affecting only a few joints), with the joints of the hands, knees, hips, and spine most commonly affected. In the unusual circumstance (less than 5% of cases) when osteoarthritis strikes in youth, there is typically some predisposing condition, such as previous trauma, developmental deformity, or underlying systemic disease such as ochronosis, hemochromatosis, or marked obesity.

In these settings the disease is called secondary osteoarthritis 
and often involves one or several predisposed joints. Gender has some influence; knees and hands are more commonly affected in women, whereas hips are more com -
monly affected in men. It is estimated that the economic toll of osteoarthritis in the United States is more than $33 billion annually. MORPHOLOGY
The early changes in osteoarthritis include alterations in the composition and structure of the matrix.

The chondrocytes have limited capacity to proliferate, and some divide to form small clones of cells that secrete newly synthesized matrix. Subsequently, vertical and horizontal 
fibrillation  and 
cracking  of the matrix occur as the superficial layers of 
the cartilage are degraded (Fig. 20–16, A). Gross examination 
at this stage reveals a soft granular-appearing articular carti -
lage surface, a condition known as chondromalacia.

Eventually, full-thickness portions of the cartilage are lost, 
and the subchondral bone plate is exposed and is smooth -
ened and burnished by friction, giving it the appearance of polished ivory 
(bone  eburnation) (Fig. 20–16, B). The 
underlying cancellous bone becomes rebuttressed by osteo -
blastic activity. Small fractures can dislodge pieces of cartilage and subchondral bone into the joint, forming loose bodies

783 Arthritis
PATHOGENESIS
Articular  cartilage  bears  the brunt  of the degenera -
tive changes  in osteoarthritis. Normal articular cartilage 
performs two functions: (1) Along with the synovial fluid, it 
provides virtually friction-free movement within the joint; and (2) in weight-bearing joints, it spreads the load across the joint surface in a manner that allows the underlying bones to absorb shock and weight.

These functions require the carti -
lage to be elastic (i.e., to regain normal architecture after compression) and to have high tensile strength. These attri -
butes are provided by proteoglycans and type II collagen, respectively, both produced by chondrocytes. As with adult bone, articular cartilage constantly undergoes matrix degra -
dation and replacement. Normal chondrocyte function is critical to maintain cartilage synthesis and degradation; any imbalance can lead to osteoarthritis.

Chondrocyte function is affected by a variety of influences. Although osteoarthritis is not exclusively a wear-and-tear phenomenon, mechanical stresses and aging nevertheless figure prominently. Genetic  factors, including polymor-
phisms and mutations in genes encoding components of the matrix and signaling molecules, contribute to osteoarthritis susceptibility. The risk of osteoarthritis also is increased with increasing bone density, as well as sustained high estrogen levels.

Regardless of the inciting stimulus, there is an imbalance 
in the expression, activity, and signaling of cytokines and growth factors that results in degradation and loss of matrix. (joint  mice). The fracture gaps allow synovial fluid to be 
forced into the subchondral regions to form fibrous walled cysts. Mushroom-shaped osteophytes (bony outgrowths) 
develop at the margins of the articular surface.

In severe disease, a fibrous synovial pannus covers the peripheral por-
tions of the articular surface. Clinical Course
Osteoarthritis is an insidious disease, predominantly affect -
ing patients beginning in their 50s and 60s. Characteristic symptoms and signs include deep, aching pain exacerbated by use, morning stiffness, crepitus (grating or popping sen -
sation in the joint), and limitation in range of movement.

Osteophyte impingement on spinal foramina can cause nerve root compression with radicular pain, muscle spasms, muscle atrophy, and neurologic deficits. Hips, knees, lower lumbar and cervical vertebrae, proximal and distal inter -
phalangeal joints of the fingers, first carpometacarpal joints, and first tarsometatarsal joints of the feet are com -
monly involved. Heberden nodes in the fingers, representing 
prominent osteophytes at the distal interphalangeal joints, are characteristic in women.

Aside from complete inactiv -
ity, there is no predicted way to prevent or halt the progres -
sion of primary osteoarthritis; it can stabilize for years but generally is slowly progressive. With time, significant joint deformity can occur, but unlike in rheumatoid arthritis (discussed next), fusion does not take place. Treatment usually is based on symptoms, with joint replacement in severe cases.

A comparison of the important morphologic features of these two disorders is presented in Figure 
20–17. Early osteoarthritis is marked by degenerating cartilage con -
taining more water and less proteoglycan (the proteoglycan component conveys turgor and elasticity). The type II colla -
gen network also is diminished, presumably as a result of decreased local synthesis and increased breakdown; chon -
drocyte apoptosis is increased.

Overall, cartilage tensile strength and resilience are compromised. In response to these degenerative changes, chondrocytes proliferate and attempt to “repair” the damage by synthesizing new collagen and proteoglycans. Although these reparative changes initially are able to keep pace, matrix changes and chondrocyte loss eventually predominate.

Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, chronic inflam -
matory autoimmune disease affecting many tissues but 
principally attacking the joints. It causes a nonsuppura -
tive proliferative synovitis that frequently progresses to 
destroy articular cartilage and underlying bone with 
resulting disabling arthritis.

When extraarticular involve-
ment develops—for example, of the skin, heart, blood vessels, muscles, and lungs—RA may resemble lupus or scleroderma. RA is a relatively common condition, with a prevalence 
of approximately 1%; it is three to five times more common in women than in men. The peak incidence is in the second to fourth decades of life, but no age is immune.

PATHOGENESIS
RA is an autoimmune disease involving complex, and still poorly understood, interactions of genetic risk factors, envi-ronment, and the immune system. The pathologic changes are caused mainly by 
cytokine-mediated  inflammation,  
with CD4 + T cells being  the principal  source  of the 
cytokines (Fig. 20–18). Many patients also produce anti-
bodies  against  cyclic  citrullinated  peptides (CCPs),  
which may contribute to the joint lesions.

CCPs are derived from proteins in which arginine residues are converted to citrulline residues posttranslationally.

vimentin are the most important and may form immune complexes that deposit in the joints. These antibodies are a diagnostic marker for the disease and may be involved in tissue injury. Like other autoimmune diseases, RA is a disorder in which 
genetic and environmental factors contribute to the break -
down of tolerance to self-antigens. - Genetic  factors: It is estimated that 50% of the risk of 
developing RA is related to genetic factors.

Susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis is linked to the HLA-DRB1 locus. Recent linkage and genome-wide association studies have revealed a large number of non-HLA genes in which poly -
morphisms are associated with RA. There is a strong asso -
ciation with a polymorphism in the PTPN22 gene, which 
encodes a tyrosine phosphatase that is postulated to inhibit T cell activation.

- Environmental  factors: Many candidate infectious 
agents whose antigens may activate T or B cells have been considered, but none has been conclusively implicated. As mentioned above, in at least 70% of patients the blood contains anti-CCP antibody, which may be produced during inflammation. Inflammatory and environmental insults such as smoking and infections may induce the citrullination of some self proteins, creating new epitopes that trigger autoimmune reactions.

It is proposed that the disease is initiated in a genetically predisposed person by activation of CD4 + helper T cells 
responding to some arthritogenic agent, possibly microbial, or to a self-antigen such as CCP (Fig. 20–18). CD4+ T
H1 and 
TH17 cells, activated B lymphocytes, plasma cells, and mac -
rophages, as well as other inflammatory cells, are found in the inflamed synovium, and in severe cases, well-formed lym -
phoid follicles with germinal centers may be present.

Numer -
ous cytokines, including IL-1, IL-8, TNF, IL-6, IL-17, and interferon-γ, have been detected in the synovial fluid. Cyto -
kines produced by the activated T cells recruit leukocytes such as macrophages, whose products cause tissue injury, and also activate resident synovial cells to produce proteolytic enzymes, such as collagenase, that mediate destruction of the cartilage, ligaments, and tendons of the joints.

Increased osteoclast activity in the joints contributes to the bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis; this may be caused by the production of the TNF family cytokine RANK ligand by acti -
vated T cells. Despite the plethora of cytokines produced in the joint in RA, TNF appears to play a pivotal role. This is demonstrated by the remarkable effectiveness of TNF antag-onists in patients with the disease, even those who are resis -
tant to other therapies.

It is suspected from a variety of experimental and clinical 
observations that antibodies also play a role in the disease. The contribution of anti-CCP was previously mentioned. About 80% of patients have serum immunoglobulin M (Ig M) (and, less frequently, Ig A) autoantibodies that bind to the Fc portions of their own (self) Ig G. These autoantibodies are called 
rheumatoid  factor.

They may form immune com -
plexes with self-Ig G that deposit in joints and other tissues, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. However, the role of rheumatoid factor in the pathogenesis of the joint or extraarticular lesions has not been established. Of interest, there seem to be two variants of RA, one characterized by presence of anti-CCP and rheumatoid factor and another in which these autoantibodies are lacking.

785 Arthritis
MORPHOLOGY
A broad spectrum of morphologic alterations are seen in RA; 
the most severe occur in the joints. RA typically manifests as 
symmetric  arthritis,  principally  affecting  the small  
joints of the hands and feet, ankles, knees, wrists, elbows, and shoulders. Most often, the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints are affected, but distal interpha -
langeal joints are spared.

Axial involvement, when it occurs, is limited to the upper cervical spine; similarly, hip joint involvement is extremely uncommon.

On histologic examina-tion, the affected joints show 
chronic  papillary  synovitis, 
characterized by (1) synovial cell hyperplasia and prolifera -
tion; (2) dense perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates (fre-quently forming lymphoid follicles) in the synovium composed of CD4+ T cells, plasma cells, and macrophages; (3) increased vascularity due to angiogenesis; (4) neutrophils and aggre -
gates of organizing fibrin on the synovial surface and in the joint space; and (5) increased osteoclast activity in the under -
lying bone, leading to synovial penetration and periarticular bone erosion.

The classic appearance is that of a pannus, 
formed by proliferating synovial lining cells admixed with inflammatory cells, granulation tissue, and fibrous connective tissue; the overgrowth of this tissue is so exuberant that the usually thin, smooth synovial membrane is transformed into lush, edematous, frondlike (villous) projections ( Fig. 20–19, 
A–C).

With full-blown inflammatory joint involvement, peri -
articular soft tissue edema usually develops, classically mani -
fested first by fusiform swelling of the proximal interphalangeal joints. With progression of the disease, the articular cartilage subjacent to the pannus is eroded and, in time, virtually destroyed. The subarticular bone also may be attacked and eroded. Eventually the pannus fills the joint space, and sub -
sequent 
fibrosis  and ossification may cause permanent 
ankylosis.

The radiographic hallmarks are joint effusions and juxtaarticular osteopenia with erosions and narrowing of the joint space and loss of articular cartilage. Destruction of

teristic deformities, including radial deviation of the wrist, 
ulnar deviation of the fingers, and flexion-hyperextension abnormalities of the fingers (swan-neck deformity, bouton -
nière deformity).

Rheumatoid  subcutaneous  nodules develop in about 
one fourth of patients, occurring along the extensor surface of the forearm or other areas subjected to mechanical pres-sure; rarely, they can form in the lungs, spleen, heart, aorta, and other viscera. Rheumatoid nodules are firm, nontender, 
oval or rounded masses as large as 2 cm in diameter.

The y 
are characterized microscopically by a central focus of fibri -
noid necrosis surrounded by a palisade of macrophages, which in turn is rimmed by granulation tissue and lympho -
cytes (Fig. 20–20). Patients with severe erosive disease, rheumatoid nodules, 
and high titers of 
rheumatoid  factor are at risk of develop -
ing vasculitic syndromes; acute necrotizing vasculitis may involve small or large arteries. Serosal involvement may mani -
fest as fibrinous pleuritis or pericarditis or both.

Lung paren-chyma may be damaged by progressive interstitial fibrosis. Ocular changes such as uveitis and keratoconjunctivitis (similar to those seen in Sjögren syndrome; see Chapter 4) 
may be prominent in some cases. Clinical Features
Although RA is basically a symmetric polyarticular arthri -
tis, there also may be constitutional symptoms such as weakness, malaise, and low-grade fever.

Many of the sys -
temic manifestations result from the same mediators that cause joint inflammation (e.g., IL-1, TNF). The arthritis first appears insidiously, with aching and stiffness of the joints, particularly in the morning. As the disease advances, the joints become enlarged, motion is limited, and in time com -
plete ankylosis may appear. Vasculitic involvement of the extremities may give rise to Raynaud phenomenon and

Helpful in making the correct diagnosis are (1) characteristic radiographic findings; (2) sterile, turbid synovial fluid with decreased viscosity, poor mucin clot formation, and inclusion-bearing neutrophils; and (3) anti-CCP and rheumatoid factor (80% of patients). The clinical course of RA is highly variable. In a minority 
of patients, the disease may stabilize or even regress; in most patients, however, it pursues a chronic, remitting-relapsing course.

Historically, the natural history of the disease has been one of progressive joint destruction leading to disability after 10 to 15 years. The outcome 
has been dramatically improved by recent advances in therapy, including aggressive treatment of early RA and the introduction of highly effective biologic agents that antagonize TNF. RA is an important cause of reactive amy -
loidosis (Chapter 4), which develops in 5% to 10% of these patients, particularly those with long-standing severe disease.

Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is not a single disease but a group of multifactorial disorders with environmental and genetic components. These disorders are of unknown etiol -
ogy and are classified according to their presentation into oligoarthritis, polyarthritis, and systemic (Still’s disease) variants.

Large joints often are affected, and symptoms and signs such as joint swelling, warmth, pain, and loss of func-tion begin before the age of 16 years and persist for more than 6 weeks. Extraarticular inflammatory manifestations such as uveitis also may be present. Common risk factors include genetic susceptibility (such as particular HLA and PTPN22 gene variants) and perhaps infection.

As in adult RA, the pathogenesis is likely to involve activation of T
H1 
and T H17 cells, which in turn activate B cells, macrophages, 
and fibroblasts to produce antibodies and a variety of cyto -
kines including TNF, IL-1, and IL-6, which eventually result in damage to articular structures. Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies
Clinical, morphologic, and genetic features distinguish these disorders from rheumatoid arthritis and other arthri -
tides.

The spondyloarthropathies are characterized by the following:
- Pathologic changes that begin in the ligamentous attach -
ments to bone rather than in the synovium
- Involvement of the sacroiliac joints, with or without 
arthritis in other peripheral joints
- Absence of rheumatoid factor (hence the designation 
seronegative)
- Association with HLA-B27
This group of disorders includes several clinical entities, of which ankylosing spondylitis is the prototype.

Others include Reiter syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, spondylitis associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, and reactive arthropathies after infections (e.g., with Yersinia, Shigella, 
Salmonella, Helicobacter, or Campylobacter).

Sacroiliitis is a 
common manifestation in all of these disorders; they are distinguished from one another by the particular periph -
eral joints involved, as well as on the basis of associated extraskeletal manifestations (for example, urethritis, con-junctivitis, and uveitis are characteristic of Reiter syn -
drome). Although triggering infections and immune mechanisms are thought to underlie most of the seronega -
tive spondyloarthropathies, their pathogenesis remains obscure.

Gout
Gout affects about 1% of the population, and shows a pre -
deliction for males. It is caused by excessive amounts of uric acid, an end product of purine metabolism, within tissues and body fluids. Monosodium urate crystals precipitate from supersaturated body fluids and induce an acute inflamma -
tory reaction. Gout is marked by recurrent episodes of acute arthritis, sometimes accompanied by the formation of large crystalline aggregates called tophi, and eventual 
permanent joint deformity.

Although an elevated level of uric acid is an essential component of gout, not all such persons develop gout, and genetic and environmental factors also contribute to its pathogenesis. Gout tradition -
ally is divided into primary and secondary forms, account -
ing for about 90% and 10% of cases, respectively ( Table 
20–3).

Primary gout designates cases in which the basic 
cause is unknown or (less commonly) in which the disor -
der is due to an inborn metabolic defect that causes hyper -
uricemia. In secondary gout, the cause of the hyperuricemia 
is known, but gout is not necessarily the main or even dominant clinical disorder. MORPHOLOGY
The major morphologic manifestations of gout are acute arthritis, chronic tophaceous arthritis, tophi in various sites, and gouty nephropathy.

Acute  arthritis is characterized by a dense neutrophilic 
infiltrate permeating the synovium and synovial fluid. Long, slender, needle-shaped 
monosodium  urate  crystals

frequently are found in the cytoplasm of the neutrophils as 
well as in small clusters in the synovium. The synovium is edematous and congested and contains scattered mononu-clear inflammatory cells. When the episode of crystallization abates and the crystals resolubilize, the attack remits. Chronic  tophaceous  arthritis evolves from repetitive 
precipitation of urate crystals during acute attacks.

The urates can heavily encrust the articular surfaces and form visible deposits in the synovium ( Fig. 20–21, A). The synovium 
becomes hyperplastic, fibrotic, and thickened by inflamma -
tory cells, forming a pannus that destroys the underlying cartilage, leading to juxtaarticular bone erosions. In severe cases, fibrous or bony ankylosis ensues, resulting in loss of joint function. T ophi  are pathognomonic  for gout.

They are formed 
by large aggregations of urate crystals surrounded by an intense inflammatory reaction of lymphocytes, macrophages, and foreign-body giant cells, attempting to engulf the masses of crystals ( Fig. 20–21, B). Tophi can appear in the articular 
cartilage of joints and in the periarticular ligaments, tendons, and soft tissues, including the ear lobes, nasal cartilages, and skin of the fingertips. Superficial tophi can lead to large ulcer -
ations of the overlying skin.

Gouty  nephropathy refers to renal complications asso -
ciated with urate deposition, variously forming medullary tophi, intratubular precipitations, or free uric acid crystals and renal calculi. Secondary complications such as pyelonephritis can occur, especially when there is urinary obstruction. PATHOGENESIS
Elevated uric acid levels can result from overproduction or reduced excretion of uric acid, or both ( Table 20–3).

Most 
cases of gout are characterized by a primary overproduction 
of uric acid. Less commonly, uric acid is produced at normal rates, and hyperuricemia occurs because of decreased renal excretion of urate. For an understanding of these influences, a brief review of normal uric acid synthesis and excretion is warranted. - Uric acid synthesis. Uric acid is the end product of 
purine catabolism; consequently increased urate synthesis typically reflects some abnormality in purine nucleotide production.

The synthesis of purine nucleotides involves two different but interlinked pathways: the de novo and salvage pathways. - The de novo  pathway is involved in the synthesis of 
purine nucleotides from nonpurine precursors. - The salvage  pathway is involved in the synthesis of 
purine nucleotides from free purine bases, derived from dietary intake and by catabolizing nucleic acids and purine nucleotides. - Uric acid excretion.

Circulating uric acid is freely fil -
tered by the glomerulus and virtually completely resorbed in the proximal tubules of the kidney. A small fraction of the resorbed uric acid is subsequently secreted by the distal nephron and excreted in the urine. Although the cause of excessive uric acid biosynthesis in 
primary  gout is unknown in most cases, rare patients have 
identifiable enzymatic defects. For example, complete lack of

Clinical Features
Gout is more common in men than in women; it does not 
usually cause symptoms before the age of 30. Risk factors for the disease include obesity, excess alcohol intake, con -
sumption of purine-r ich foods, diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and renal failure. Polymorphisms in genes involved in the transport and homeostasis of urate such as URAT1 and GLUT9 also are associated with hyperuricemia 
and gout.

Four stages are classically recognized: (1) asymptomatic 
hyperuricemia, (2) acute gouty arthritis, (3) “intercritical” gout, and (4) chronic tophaceous gout. Asymptomatic hyper-
uricemia appears around puberty in males and after meno -
pause in women. After a long interval of years, acute 
arthritis appears in the form of sudden onset, excruciating joint pain associated with localized erythema, and warmth; constitutional symptoms are uncommon, except possibly mild fever.

The vast majority of first attacks are monoar -
ticular; 50% occur in the first metatarsophalangeal joint HGPRT, an enzyme essential in the salvage pathway, gives rise to the 
Lesch-Nyhan  syndrome. In secondary  gout, 
hyperuricemia can be caused by increased urate production (e.g., rapid cell lysis during chemotherapy for lymphoma or leukemia) or decreased excretion (chronic renal insuffi-ciency), or both.

Reduced renal excretion may also be caused by drugs such as thiazide diuretics, presumably because of effects on uric acid tubular transport. Whatever the cause, increased levels of uric acid in the 
blood and other body fluids (e.g., synovium) lead to the precipitation of monosodium urate crystals. This, in turn, triggers a chain of events that culminate in joint injury ( Fig. 20–22).

Urate crystals are thought to directly activate the complement system, leading to production of chemotactic and pro-inflammatory mediators. The crystals are phagocy -
tosed by macrophages and recognized by the intracellular sensor called the inflammasome (Chapter 2), which is acti-vated and stimulates the production of the cytokine IL-1. IL-1 is a mediator of inflammation, and causes local accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in the joints and synovial membranes.

These cells become activated, leading to the release of a host of additional mediators including chemo -
kines, other cytokines, toxic free radicals, and leukotrienes—particularly leukotriene B
4. The activated neutrophils also 
liberate destructive lysosomal enzymes.

spread from osteomyelitis or a soft tissue abscess. Infec -
tious arthritis is serious because it can cause rapid joint 
destruction and permanent deformities. Suppurative Arthritis
Bacteria can seed joints during episodes of bacteremia; joint infection with such microorganisms almost uniformly results in a suppurative arthritis. Although virtually any bacteria can be causal, Haemophilus influenzae predominates 
in children younger than 2 years of age, S.

aureus is the 
main causative agent in older children and adults, and the gonococcus is prevalent in older adolescents and young adults. Patients with sickle cell disease are prone to Salmo-
nella infection at any age. Both genders are affected equally, except for gonococcal arthritis, which occurs mainly in sexually active women.

In this group, those with deficiency of certain complement proteins (C5, C6, and C7) are par-ticularly susceptible to disseminated gonococcal infections and hence arthritis. The classic presentation is one of sudden onset of pain, 
redness, and swelling of the affected joint(s), with restricted range of motion. Fever, leukocytosis, and elevated erythro -
cyte sedimentation rate are common. In gonococcal infec-tions, the course tends to be more subacute.

In 90% of cases of nongonococcal suppurative arthritis, the infection involves only a single joint—usually the knee—followed in order by hip, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and sternoclavicular joints. Joint aspiration typically yields a purulent fluid in which the causal agent can be identified.

Lyme Arthritis
Lyme disease is caused by infection with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted by deer ticks of the Ixodes 
ricinus complex; it is named for the Connecticut town where the disease was first recognized in the 1970s. With more than 20,000 cases reported annually, it is the leading arthropod-borne disease in the United States.

As with another major spirochetal disease, syphilis, Lyme disease involves multiple organ systems and in its classic form progresses through three successive stages. In stage 1, 
Borrelia spirochetes multiply at the site of the tick bite and cause an expanding area of redness, often with an indurated or pale center. This skin lesion, called erythema 
chronicum migrans, may be accompanied by fever and lymphadenopathy but usually disappears in a few weeks’ time.

In stage 2, the early disseminated stage, spirochetes 
spread hematogenously and cause secondary annular skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, migratory joint and muscle pain, cardiac arrhythmias, and meningitis, often with cranial nerve involvement. Diagnostically useful antibod -
ies (usually both Ig M and Ig G) against Borrelia antigens 
appear in the serum at this stage of the disease.

Some 
spirochetes, however, escape host antibody and T cell responses by sequestering themselves in the central nervous system or within endothelial cells. In stage 3, the late dis-
seminated stage, which occurs 2 or 3 years after the initial bite, Lyme Borrelia organisms cause a chronic arthritis, 
sometimes with severe damage to large joints, and an encephalitis that ranges in severity from mild to debilitating.

Lyme arthritis develops in roughly 60% to 80% of 
untreated patients and is the dominant feature of late (great toe), and 90% in the instep, ankle, heel, or wrist. Untreated, acute gouty arthritis may last for hours to weeks, but it gradually completely resolves, and the patient enters an asymptomatic intercritical period. Although some 
fortunate persons never have another attack, most experi -
ence a second episode within months to a few years.

In the absence of appropriate therapy, the attacks recur at shorter intervals and frequently become polyarticular. Eventually, after a decade or so, symptoms fail to resolve completely after each attack, and the disease progresses to chronic 
tophaceous gout. At this stage, radiographs show character -
istic juxtaarticular bone erosion caused by the crystal deposits and loss of the joint space. Progression leads to severe crippling disease.

Renal manifestations of gout can appear as renal colic 
associated with the passage of gravel and stones, and can evolve into chronic gouty nephropathy. About 20% of persons with chronic gout die of renal failure. Numerous drugs are available to abort or prevent acute 
attacks of arthritis and mobilize tophaceous deposits. Their use is important, because many aspects of gout are related to the duration and severity of hyperuricemia.

Generally, gout does not materially shorten the life span, but it can certainly impair quality of life. Pseudogout
Pseudogout also is known as chondrocalcinosis or, more for -
mally, calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition disease. The crystal deposits first appear in structures composed of cartilage such as menisci, intervertebral discs, and articular surfaces. When the deposits enlarge enough, they may rupture, inducing an inflammatory reaction.

Pseudogout typically first occurs in persons 50 years of age or older, becoming more common with increasing age, and eventu -
ally reaching a prevalence of 30% to 60% in those age 85 or older. There is no gender or race predilection. Although pathways leading to crystal formation are not 
understood, they are likely to involve the overproduction or decreased breakdown of pyrophosphate, resulting in its accumulation and eventual crystallization with calcium in the matrix surrounding chondrocytes.

Mutations in a transmembrane pyrophosphate transporter are associated with a rare familial form of the disease, in which crystals develop relatively early in life and there is severe osteoarthritis. Much of the subsequent joint pathology in pseudogout 
involves the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells and is similar to that in gout (see earlier).

Duration of clinical signs can be from several days to weeks, and joint involvement may be monoarticular or polyarticular; the knees, followed by the wrists, elbows, shoulders, and ankles, are most commonly affected. Ultimately, approxi -
mately 50% of patients experience significant joint damage. Therapy is supportive; no known treatment prevents or retards crystal formation. Infectious Arthritis
Microorganisms of any type can lodge in joints during hematogenous dissemination.

Articular structures can also become infected by direct inoculation or by contiguous

soft tissue tumors. In comparison, reactive tumor-like lesions 
such as ganglions and synovial cysts are much more common 
than neoplasms; these typically result from trauma or 
degenerative processes. Here we discuss the more common or clinically significant tumor-like lesions and neoplasms of joints and associated soft tissues.

Ganglion and Synovial Cysts
A ganglion is a small cyst (less than 1.5 cm in diameter) 
located near a joint capsule or tendon sheath; the wrist is an especially common site. Lesions manifest as firm to fluc -
tuant pea-sized nodules that are translucent to light. Micro -
scopically, they consist of fluid-filled spaces that lack a true cell lining, apparently because they stem from cystic degen -
eration of connective tissue. Coalescence of adjacent cysts can produce multilocular lesions.

The cyst contents resem-ble synovial fluid, although often there is no communica -
tion with the joint space. Ganglions typically are completely asymptomatic. Classically, these can be treated by “Bible therapy”: Whacking the affected area with a large tome usually is sufficient to rupture the cyst, but reaccumulation may recur. Despite their name, they have no relationship to ganglia of the nervous system.

Herniation of synovium through a joint capsule or 
massive enlargement of a bursa can produce a synovial cyst. A good example is the Baker cyst that occurs in the popliteal 
fossa. T enosynovial Giant Cell T umor
Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a catchall term for 
several closely related benign neoplasms of synovium.

Although these lesions previously were considered reac -
tive proliferations (hence the earlier designation synovitis), 
they are consistently associated with an acquired (1;2) translocation that fuses the promoter of the collagen 6A3 gene to the coding sequence of the growth factor M-CSF.

Classic examples are diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumor, previously known as pigmented villonodular synovitis 
(PVNS), involving joint synovium, and localized tenosyno -
vial giant cell tumor, also known as giant cell tumor of tendon 
sheath. Both types typically arise in people in their 20s to 40s, without gender predilection.disease.

The arthritis may be caused by immune responses against Borrelia antigens that cross-react with proteins in 
the joints, but the exact mechanisms are not yet under -
stood. The disease tends to be migratory, with remissions and relapses. It involves mainly large joints, especially the knees, shoulders, elbows, and ankles, in descending order of frequency.

Histologic examination reveals a chronic papillary synovitis with synoviocyte hyperplasia, fibrin deposition, mononuclear cell infiltrates, and onion-skin thickening of arterial walls; in severe cases, the morphol -
ogy closely resembles that of rheumatoid arthritis. In only 25% of cases do silver stains reveal a sprinkling of organ -
isms, and formal diagnosis of Lyme arthritis may depend on the clinical picture, including history, and/or appropri-ate serologic studies.

Chronic arthritis with pannus forma -
tion and permanent deformities develops in roughly 1 in 10 patients. SUMMARY
Arthritis
- Osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) is by far the most 
common joint disease; it is primarily a degenerative dis -
order of articular cartilage in which matrix breakdown exceeds synthesis. Inflammation is secondary. The vast majority of cases occur without apparent precipitating cause except increasing age.

Local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators (IL-1, TNF , nitric oxide) may contribute to the progression of the joint degeneration. - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflam -
matory disease that affects mainly the joints, especially small joints, but can affect multiple tissues.

RA is caused by an autoimmune response against self-antigen(s) such as citrullinated proteins, which leads to T cell reactions in the joint with production of cytokines that activate phago -
cytes that damage tissues and stimulate proliferation of synovial cells (synovitis). The cytokine TNF plays a central role, and antagonists against TNF are of great clinical benefit. Antibodies may also contribute to the disease. - Gout and pseudogout.

Increased circulating levels of uric acid (gout) or calcium pyrophosphate ( pseudogout) can 
lead to crystal deposition in the joint space. Resulting inflammatory cell recruitment and activation lead to car -
tilage degradation, fibrosis, and arthritis. - Either direct infection of a joint space ( suppurative arthritis) 
or cross-reactive immune responses to systemic infec -
tions (e.g., in some cases of Lyme arthritis) can lead to joint 
inflammation and injury.

MORPHOLOGY
Grossly, TGCTs are red-brown to orange-yellow. In the diffuse variant the joint synovium becomes a contorted mass of red-brown folds, finger-like projections, and nodules ( Fig. 20–23, A). By contrast, the localized type is well circum -
scribed and contained. Tumor cells in both lesions resemble synoviocytes, and numerous hemosiderin-laden macro -
phages, osteoclast-like giant cells and hyalinized stromal col -
lagen also are present (Fig. 20–23, B).

The tumor cells spread 
along the surface and infiltrate the subsynovial compartment. In localized TGCT, the cells grow in a solid nodular aggregate. Other typical findings include hemosiderin deposits, foamy macrophages, multinucleate giant cells, and zones of scarring. JOINT TUMORS AND TUMOR-LIKE 
LESIONS
Primary neoplasms of joints are uncommon and usually benign; in general, they reflect the cells and tissue types (synovial membrane, vessels, fibrous tissue, and cartilage) native to the joints.

Benign tumors are much more frequent than their malignant counterparts. The rare malignant neo -
plasms of these structures are discussed below with the

of proliferating cells in tenosynovial giant cell tumor bulging the synovial lining. Clinical Features
Diffuse TGCT usually mimics a monoarticular arthritis; it 
affects the knee in 80% of cases, followed by the hip and ankle. Patients typically complain of pain, locking, and recurrent swelling.

Tumor progression limits the range of movement of the joint. Aggressive lesions erode into adja -
cent bones and soft tissues, causing confusion with other tumors. In contrast, localized TGCT presents as a solitary, slowly growing, painless mass frequently involving wrist and finger tendon sheaths; it is the most common soft tissue tumor of the hand. Cortical erosion of adjacent bone occurs in approximately 15% of cases.

Both lesions are ame -
nable to surgical resection, but also prone to local recur -
rence. Recognition of the association of TGCT and M-CSF gene rearrangement and overexpression has inspired trials of antagonists of M-CSF or its cognate receptor (M-CSFR, a tyrosine kinase); some excellent responses have been reported. SOFT  TISSUE
By convention, the term soft tissue describes any nonepithe-
lial tissue other than bone, cartilage, central nervous system, hematopoietic, and lymphoid tissues.

The focus of this section is on soft tissue tumors, which are classified according to the tissue type they recapitulate, including fat, fibrous tissue, and neurovascular tissue ( Table 20–4). In 
some soft tissue neoplasms, however, no corresponding normal counterpart is known.

Although soft tissue tumors are classified based on recognizable lines of differentiation, current evidence indicates that these tumors arise from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells and are not the result of malignant transformation of mature mesenchymal cells. With the exception of skeletal muscle neoplasms (see further on), benign soft tissue tumors outnumber their malignant counterparts by at least a hundred-fold.

In the United States, approximately 12,000 soft tissue sarcomas are diagnosed annually, representing less than 1% of all invasive malignancies. However, they cause 2% of all cancer deaths, reflecting their lethal nature. Most soft tissue tumors arise without antecedent causes; 
rarely, radiation exposure, burn injury, or toxin exposure is implicated.

Kaposi sarcoma ( Chapter 9) is associated 
with the human herpesvirus 8, but viruses probably are 
not important in the pathogenesis of most sarcomas in humans. A small minority of soft tissue tumors are associ -
ated with genetic syndromes, most notably neurofibroma -
tosis type 1 (neurofibroma, malignant schwannoma), Gardner syndrome (fibromatosis), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (soft tissue sarcoma), and Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome (telangiectasia).

Specific chromosomal abnormalities and genetic derangements in these syndromes provide impor -
tant clues to the genesis of the neoplasms. Like their mes -
enchymal brethren, the hematopoietic neoplasms, many soft tissue tumors are associated with highly characteristic chromosomal rearrangements, most commonly transloca -
tions that provide insight into pathogenesis and are diag -
nostically useful.

Indeed, some tumors, such as synovial sarcoma, are virtually defined by their associated translocations. Soft tissue tumors can arise in any location, but approxi-
mately 40% of sarcomas occur in the lower extremities, especially the thigh. While the overall incidence of sarco -
mas increases with age, 15% arise in children.

Certain sar -
comas tend to appear in certain age groups—for example, rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood, synovial sarcoma in young adulthood, and liposarcoma and pleomorphic fibro -
blastic or undifferentiated sarcomas in later adult life. Soft tissue sarcomas usually are treated with wide surgical exci -
sion (frequently limb-sparing), with irradiation and sys -
temic therapy reserved for large high-grade tumors.

Several features of soft tissue sarcomas influence 
prognosis:
- Diagnostic classification. This is based not only on his -
tology, but also on immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, cytogenetics, and molecular genetics, which are indispensable in assigning the correct diagnosis in some cases.

MORPHOLOGY
Liposarcomas usually manifest as relatively well-circumscribed 
lesions.

Several different histologic subtypes are recognized, including the low-grade variant, 
well-differentiated  lipo-
sarcoma, and the myxoid/round  cell liposarcoma, 
characterized by abundant, mucoid extracellular matrix. Some well-differentiated lesions can be difficult to distinguish from lipomas, whereas very poorly differentiated tumors can resemble various other high-grade malignancies.

In most cases, cells indicative of fatty differentiation known as lipo-
blasts  are present; they have cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles 
that scallop the nucleus (Fig. 20–24), and appearance reca-pitulating that of fetal fat cells. - Grading. Grading, usually on a scale of I to III, is based on the degree of differentiation, the average number of mitoses per high-power field, cellularity, pleomorphism, and an estimate of the extent of necrosis (presumably a reflection of rate of growth).

Mitotic counts and necrosis are the most important predictors. - Staging. With tumors larger than 20 cm, metastases 
develop in 80% of cases; by contrast, for tumors 5 cm or 
smaller, metastases occur in only 30% of cases. - Location. In general, tumors arising in superficial loca -
tions (e.g., skin) have a better prognosis than deep-seated lesions; overall, the 10-year survival rate for sarcomas is approximately 40%.

Presented next is an overview of the individual tumors and tumor-like lesions; only the more common forms are covered here. Others are covered elsewhere in the book. TUMORS OF ADIPOSE TISSUE
Lipoma
Lipomas are benign tumors of fat and are the most common soft tissue tumors in adults. Most lipomas are solitary lesions; multiple lipomas usually suggest the presence 
of rare hereditary syndromes.

Lipomas can be subclassified on the basis of their histologic features and/or characteris -
tic chromosomal rearrangements. Most lipomas are mobile, slowly enlarging, painless masses (although angiolipomas can manifest with local pain); complete excision usually is curative. Conventional lipomas (the most common subtype) are 
soft, yellow, well-encapsulated masses of mature adipo -
cytes; they can vary considerably in size.

On histologic examination, they consist of mature white fat cells with no pleomorphism. Liposarcoma
Liposarcomas are malignant neoplasms with adipocyte dif -
ferentiation. They occur most commonly in the fifth and sixth decades of life. Most liposarcomas arise in the deep soft tissues or in the retroperitoneum.

The prognosis of liposarcomas is greatly influenced by the histologic subtype; well-differentiated tumors grow slowly and 
are associated with a more favorable outlook than the aggressive myxoid/round cell and pleomorphic variants, which tend to recur after excision and metastasize to lungs. Amplification of a region of 12q is common in well-differentiated liposarcomas; this region contains the MDM2 
gene, whose product binds and degrades the p53 protein.

A t(12;16) chromosomal translocation is associated with myxoid/round cell liposarcomas; this rearrangement creates a fusion gene encoding an abnormal transcription factor that may interfere with adipocyte differentiation. FIBROUS TUMORS AND 
TUMOR-LIKE LESIONS
Fibrous tissue proliferations are a heterogeneous group of lesions. At one end of the spectrum, nodular fasciitis is not 
a true tumor but rather a reactive, self-limited proliferation.

## Page 807

793 Fibrous Tumors and Tumor-Like Lesions 
athletic adolescents and young adults after trauma. The 
affected area initially is swollen and painful, and subse -
quently evolves into a painless, hard, well-demarcated mass. It is critical to distinguish this lesion from extraskel -
etal osteosarcoma. Simple excision usually is curative.

Fibromatoses
The fibromatoses are a group of fibroblastic proliferations distinguished by their tendency to grow in an infiltrative fashion and, in many cases, to recur after surgical removal. Although some lesions are locally aggressive, they do not 
metastasize. The fibromatoses are divided into two major clinicopathologic groups: superficial and deep.

- The superficial fibromatoses arise in the superficial fascia 
and include such entities as palmar fibromatosis ( Dupuy-
tren contracture) and penile fibromatosis (Peyronie disease). Superficial lesions are genetically distinct from their deep-seated cousins and are generally more innocuous (they can be associated with trisomy 3 and 8); they also come to clinical attention earlier, because they cause deformity of the involved structure.

- The deep fibromatoses include the so-called desmoid tumors 
that arise in the abdominal wall and muscles of the trunk and extremities, and within the abdomen (mesentery and pelvic walls). They can be isolated lesions, or mul -
tiple, as a component of Gardner syndrome, an autosomal 
dominant disorder including colonic adenomatous polyps and osteomas. Mutations in the APC or β-catenin 
genes are present in a majority of these tumors.

Deep fibromatoses tend to grow in a locally aggressive manner and often recur after excision. At the other end, fibrosarcomas are highly malignant 
neoplasms that tend to recur locally and can metastasize. Fibromatoses fall somewhere in the middle; these are benign lesions that infiltrate locally and often can defy attempts at surgical excision. Distinguishing among the various lesions requires considerable skill and diagnostic experience.

Reactive Proliferations
Nodular Fasciitis
Nodular fasciitis is a self-limited fibroblastic proliferation (Fig. 20–25) that typically occurs in adults on the volar aspect of the forearm, the chest, or the back. Patients char -
acteristically present with a several-week history of a soli -
tary, rapidly growing, and occasionally painful mass. Preceding trauma is noted in 10% to 15% of cases. Nodular fasciitis rarely recurs after excision.

Myositis Ossificans
Myositis ossificans is distinguished from other fibroblastic proliferations by the presence of metaplastic bone. It usually 
develops in the proximal muscles of the extremities in 
Figure  20–24 Myxoid liposarcoma. Adult-appearing fat cells and more 
primitive cells, with lipid vacuoles ( lipoblasts), are scattered in abundant 
myxoid matrix and a rich, arborizing capillary network. Figure  20–25 Nodular fasciitis.

A highly cellular lesion composed of 
plump, randomly oriented spindle cells surrounded by myxoid stroma. Note the prominent mitotic activity (arrowheads). MORPHOLOGY
Fibromatoses are gray-white, firm to rubbery, poorly demar -
cated, infiltrative masses 1 to 15 cm in g reatest dimension. On histologic examination, they are composed of plump 
spindle cells arranged in broad sweeping fascicles that pen -
etrate the adjacent tissue; mitoses are few in number.

Immu -
nohistochemical and ultrastructural studies show that the tumor cells are fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Some 
lesions may be quite cellular, particularly early in their evolu -
tion, whereas others contain abundant dense collagen. In addition to being disfiguring or disabling, fibromato -
ses occasionally are painful. Although curable by adequate excision, they often recur when incompletely removed due to their infiltrative nature.

For those tumors that cannot be resected, therapeutic options include watchful waiting, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Fibrosarcoma
Fibrosarcomas are malignant neoplasms composed of fibroblasts. Most occur in adults, typically in the deep tissues of the thigh, knee, and retroperitoneal area. They tend to grow slowly, and have usually been present for several years at the time of diagnosis. As with other

Pleomorphic Fibroblastic Sarcoma/Pleomorphic 
Undifferentiated Sarcoma
Tumors of this type originally fell under the diagnostic 
rubric “malignant fibrous histiocytoma,” but with use of objective immunohistochemical markers it became evident that this was a wastebasket diagnostic category that included a number of poorly differentiated sarcomas, such as leiomyosarcomas and liposarcomas.

The common histo -
logic features that define this group of poorly differentiated sarcomas are cytologic pleomorphism, the presence of bizarre multinucleate cells, and storiform architecture. Currently, tumors with this histologic appearance that exhibit fibroblastic differentiation are designated undiffer -
entiated pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma or pleomorphic fibroblastic sarcoma (Fig. 20–27).

They usually are large 
(5 cm to 20 cm), gray-white unencapsulated masses that 
often appear deceptively circumscribed. They usually arise in the musculature of the proximal extremities or in the retroperitoneum. Most of these tumors are extremely aggressive, recur unless widely excised, and have a meta -
static rate of 30% to 50%. SKELETAL MUSCLE TUMORS
Tumors of skeletal muscle differentiation are almost 
all malignant.

Rhabdomyoma, a benign type of skeletal muscle tumor, is rare and is most often found in the heart (Chapter 10). Rhabdomyosarcoma
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood and adolescence, usually appearing before age 20. Of interest, it occurs most commonly in 
the head and neck or genitourinary tract, usually at sites where there is little, if any, normal skeletal muscle. This tumor occurs in three different histologic types, as 
described below.

Chromosomal translocations are found in 
most cases of the alveolar variant; the more common t(2;13) translocation fuses the PAX3 gene on chromosome 2 with 
the FKHR gene on chromosome 13. PAX3 functions sarcomas, fibrosarcomas often recur locally after excision (in more than 50% of cases) and can metastasize hematog -
enously (in greater than 25% of cases), usually to the 
lungs.

MORPHOLOGY
Fibrosarcomas are soft unencapsulated, infiltrative masses that frequently contain areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Better-differentiated lesions can appear deceptively circum-scribed. Histologic examination discloses all degrees of dif -
ferentiation, from tumors that closely resemble fibromatoses, to densely packed lesions with spindle cells growing in a her -
ringbone fashion (Fig.

20–26), while others have a myxoid stroma (myxofibrosarcoma), and some are highly cellular neoplasms exhibiting architectural disarray, pleomorphism, frequent mitoses, and necrosis. Figure  20–26 Fibrosarcoma. Malignant spindle cells here are arranged 
in a herringbone pattern. Figure  20–27 Pleomorphic fibroblastic sar coma. There are fascicles of 
plump spindle cells in a swirling (storiform) pattern.

FIBROHISTIOCYTIC TUMORS
Fibrohistiocytic tumors are composed of a mixture of 
fibroblasts and phagocytic, lipid-laden cells resembling activated tissue macrophages (also called histiocytes by 
morphologists). The neoplastic cells in many cases are fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Consequently, the term fibrohistiocytic is descriptive and does not connote a specific line of differentiation.

These tumors span a broad range of histologic patterns and biologic behavior, from self-limited benign lesions to aggressive high-grade sarcomas. Benign Fibrous Histiocytoma (Dermatofibroma)
Dermatofibromas are relatively common benign lesions in 
adults manifesting as circumscribed, small (less than 1 cm) 
mobile nodules in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue.

On histologic evaluation, these typically consist of bland, inter -
lacing spindle cells admixed with foamy, lipid-rich histiocyte-like cells. The borders of the lesions tend to be infiltrative, but extensive local invasion does not occur. They are cured by simple excision. The pathogenesis of these lesions is uncertain.

795 Synovial Sarcoma
muscle cells anywhere in the body but are encountered 
most commonly in the uterus (Chapter 18) and the skin. Leiomyosarcoma
Leiomyosarcomas account for 10% to 20% of soft tissue sarcomas. They occur in adults, more commonly females. Skin and deep soft tissues of the extremities and retroperi -
toneum (inferior vena cava) are common sites. These neo -
plasms manifest as firm, painless masses; retroperitoneal tumors can be large and bulky and cause abdominal symp -
toms.

Histologic examination shows spindle cells with cigar-shaped nuclei arranged in interwoven fascicles. Treatment depends on the size, location, and grade of the tumor. Superficial or cutaneous leiomyosarcomas usually are small and carry a good prognosis, whereas retroperito -
neal tumors are large and difficult to excise and cause death by both local extension and metastatic spread.

SYNOVIAL SARCOMA
Synovial sarcoma was originally believed to recapitulate synovium; however, the phenotype of the neoplastic cells bears no resemblance to a synoviocyte, and despite the name, less than 10% of tumors are intra-articular. Synovial sarcomas account for approximately 10% of all soft tissue sarcomas, typically occurring in persons in their 20s to 40s.

They usually develop in deep soft tissues around the large joints of the extremities, with 60% to 70% occurring around the knee; many have been present for several years at the time of presentation.

Most synovial sarcomas show a char -
acteristic (X;18) translocation that produces a fusion gene encoding a chimeric transcription factor.upstream of genes that control skeletal muscle differentia -
tion, and tumor development probably involves dysregu -
lation of muscle differentiation by the chimeric PAX3-FKHR protein. MORPHOLOGY
Rhabdomyosarcoma is histologically subclassified into the 
embryonal,  alveolar, and pleomorphic variants. The 
gross appearance of these tumors is variable.

Some, particu -
larly the embryonal variant when arising near the mucosal surfaces of the bladder or vagina, can manifest as soft, gelati -
nous, grapelike masses, designated 
sarcoma  botryoides. In other cases they are poorly defined, infiltrating tan-white masses. The rhabdomyoblast is the diagnostic cell in all 
types; it has granular eosinophilic cytoplasm rich in thick and thin filaments. The rhabdomyoblasts may be round or elon -
gated; the latter are known as 
tadpole  or strap  cells (Fig.

20–28) and may contain cross-striations visible by light microscopy. The diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma is based on the demonstration of skeletal muscle differentiation, either in the form of sarcomeres under the electron microscope or by immunohistochemical demonstration of skeletal muscle–specific transcription factors such as myogenin and MYOD-1, and the muscle-associated intermediate filament desmin.

Rhabdomyosarcomas are aggressive neoplasms treated 
with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radia-tion. Location, histologic appearance, and tumor genetics all impact the likelihood of cure, with progressively wors -
ening rates for embryonal, pleomorphic, and alveolar vari-ants, in that order. The malignancy is curable in almost two thirds of children; the prognosis is much less favorable in adults with the pleomorphic type.

SMOOTH MUSCLE TUMORS
Leiomyoma
Benign smooth muscle tumors, or leiomyomas, are common, 
well-circumscribed neoplasms that can arise from smooth 
Figure  20–28 Rhabdomyosarcoma. The rhabdomyoblasts are large and 
round and have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm; no cross-striations are 
evident here. MORPHOLOGY
On histologic examination, synovial sarcomas may be bipha-
sic or monophasic.

Classic biphasic synovial sarcoma exhib-
its differentiation of tumor cells into both epithelial-type cells and spindle cells. The epithelial cells are cuboidal to columnar and form glands or grow in solid cords or aggregates.

sparing surgery and chemotherapy. Common metastatic 
sites are lung, bone, and regional lymph nodes. Reported 5-year survival rates range from 25% to 62%, and only 10% to 30% of the patients live longer than 10 years. BIBLIOGRAPHY

The major components of the neuromuscular system, the 
peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles, act as both effectors and sensors for the central nervous system, and in doing so allow thought and sensation to give rise to physical actions and cognitive responses.

The principal component of the motor system is the motor unit, which is composed 
of one lower motor neuron and its associated peripheral axon, neuromuscular junctions, and innervated skeletal muscle fibers. Both the anatomic distribution of lesions and specific signs and symptoms are helpful in classifying neu -
romuscular diseases and in distinguishing them from dis -
eases of the central nervous system.

Accordingly, the discussion of neuromuscular disorders is organized along anatomic lines, highlighting the clinical features that are most useful in their diagnosis. DISORDERS OF PERIPHERAL NERVES
The two major functional elements of peripheral nerves are axonal processes and their myelin sheaths, which are made by Schwann cells.

Axonal diameter and myelin thickness are correlated with each other and with conduction veloc -
ity; they can be used to distinguish among different types of axons, which mediate distinct sensory modalities and motor function. Light touch, for example, is transmitted by thickly myelinated large-diameter axons with fast conduc-tion velocities, while temperature sensation is transmitted by slow, unmyelinated thin axons.

In the case of myelin -
ated axons, one Schwann cell makes and maintains exactly one myelin segment, or internode, along a single axon ( Fig. 21–1, A). Adjacent internodes are separated by nodes of 
Ranvier. Peripheral nerves contain a mixture of different types of axons. These and the intervening endoneurial connective tissue are arranged into fascicles that are ensheathed by a layer of perineurial cells.

The perineurial cells are similar to meningeal cells and help to maintain the blood-nerve barrier in the individual fascicles. Patterns of Peripheral Nerve Injury
Most peripheral neuropathies can be subclassified as either axonal or demyelinating, even though some diseases exhibit mixed features. Axonal neuropathies are caused by 
insults that directly injure the axon. The entire distal portion of an affected axon degenerates. Axonal degenera -
tion is associated with secondary myelin loss ( Fig.

21–1, B), 
a process sometimes referred to as Wallerian degeneration. Regeneration takes place through axonal regrowth and subsequent remyelination of the distal axon ( Fig. 21–1, C). The morphologic hallmark of axonal neuropathies is a decrease in the density of axons, which in electrophysio -
logic studies correlates with a decrease in the strength of amplitude of nerve impulses.

Demyelinating neuropathies are characterized by damage 
to Schwann cells or myelin with relative axonal sparing, resulting in abnormally slow nerve conduction velocities. Demyelination typically occurs in individual myelin 
internodes randomly; this process is termed segmental 
demyelination (Fig. 21–1, B). Morphologically, demyelinat-
ing neuropathies show a relatively normal density of axons and features of segmental demyelination and repair.

This is recognized by the presence of axons with abnormally thin myelin sheaths and short internodes (Fig. 21–1, C). These latter changes are best demonstrated on teased fiber preparations, which allow the examination of several adja -
cent myelin internodes along a segment of an individual axon (described later). Peripheral Nerves and Muscles See T argeted Therapy available online at

Disorders Associated with Peripheral 
Nerve Injury
Many different diseases may be associated with peripheral 
neuropathy (Table 21–1). We discuss next in some detail selected entities that are prototypical for a specific type of polyneuropathy (e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome) or are common (e.g., diabetic neuropathy).

Guillain-Barré Syndrome
Guillain-Barré syndrome is one of the most common life-threatening diseases of the peripheral nervous system. It is a rapidly progressive acute demyelinating disorder affect -
ing motor axons that results in ascending weakness that may lead to death from failure of respiratory muscles over a period of only several days.

It appears to be triggered by an infection or a vaccine that breaks down self-tolerance, Peripheral neuropathies fall into several anatomic pat -
terns and may cause selective sensory or motor axon damage, or a mixture of both. - Polyneuropathies usually affect peripheral nerves in a symmetric, length-dependent fashion. Axonal loss is typically diffuse and more pronounced in the distal seg-ments of the longest nerves.

Patients commonly present with loss of sensation and paresthesias that start in the toes and spread upward to the knees and then involve the hands in a “stocking-and-glove” distribution.

- Polyneuritis multiplex, in which the damage randomly 
affects portions of individual nerves, resulting (for example) in a right radial nerve palsy and wrist drop together with loss of sensation in the left foot
- A simple mononeuropathy involving only a single nerve 
most commonly is the result of traumatic injury or entrapment (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome). Figure 21–1 Patterns of peripheral nerve damage.

A, In normal motor units, type I and type II myofibers are arranged in a “checkerboard” distribu-
tion, and the internodes along the motor axons are uniform in thickness and length. B, Acute axonal injury ( left axon) results in degeneration of the 
distal axon and its associated myelin sheath, with atrophy of denervated myofibers. By contrast, acute demyelinating disease ( right axon) produces 
random segmental degeneration of individual myelin internodes, while sparing the axon.

C, Regeneration of axons after injury ( left axon) allows con-
nections with myofibers to re-form. The regenerated axon is myelinated by proliferating Schwann cells, but the new internodes are shorter and the 
myelin sheaths are thinner than the original ones. Remission of demyelinating disease ( right axon) allows remyelination to take place, but the new 
internodes also are shorter and have thinner myelin sheaths than flanking normal undamaged internodes. B ANeurons

thereby leading to an autoimmune response.

Associated 
infectious agents include Campylobacter jejuni, Epstein-Barr 
virus, cytomegalovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus. The injury is most extensive in the nerve roots and proximal nerve segments and is associated with mononu -
clear cell infiltrates rich in macrophages. Both humoral and cellular immune responses are believed to play a role in the disease process.

Treatments include plasmapheresis (to remove offending antibodies), intravenous immunoglobu -
lin infusions (which suppress immune responses through unclear mechanisms) and supportive care, such as ventila -
tory support. Patients who survive the initial acute phase of the disease usually recover over time. Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) typically manifests as a symmetric demyelinating disease.

Both motor and sensory abnormalities are common, such as difficulty in walking, weakness, numbness, and pain 
or tingling sensations. Like Guillain-Barré syndrome, 
CIDP is immune-mediated and occurs at increased fre -
quency in patients with other immune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and HIV infection. In con -
trast with Guillain-Barré syndrome, however, CIDP follows a chronic, relapsing-remitting or progressive course.

The peripheral nerves show segments of demyelination 
and remyelination (Fig. 21-2, A). In long-standing cases, chronically regenerating Schwann cells may concentrically wrap around axons in multiple layers in an onion-skin pattern. Treatment includes plasmapheresis and adminis -
tration of immunosuppressive agents. Some patients recover completely, but more often recurrent bouts of symptomatic disease lead to permanent loss of nerve function.

Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy
Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy 
(Chapter 19). Neuropathies usually arise in diabetics with long-standing disease. They include autonomic neuropa -
thy, lumbosacral radiculopathies, and distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy; these may occur singly or together. Autonomic neuropathy is characterized by changes 
in bowel, bladder, cardiac, or sexual function.

Lumbosacral 
radiculopathy usually manifests with asymmetric pain that can progress to lower extremity weakness and muscle atrophy. Distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy is the 
most common form of diabetic neuropathy. Sensory axons are more severely affected than motor axons, so the clinical presentation usually is dominated by paresthesias and numbness.

This form of diabetic polyneuropathy results from the length-dependent degeneration of peripheral nerves and does not neatly fit into the axonal or demyelin -
ating category but instead often exhibits features of both.

The pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy is complex; accu-mulation of advanced glycosylation end products, hyper -
glycemia, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, microvascular changes, changes in axonal metabolism, abnormal protein C levels, and neurotrophic factors all have been implicated. Strict glycemic control is the best form of therapy.

Toxic, Vasculitic, and Inherited Forms of 
Peripheral Neuropathy
- Drugs and environmental toxins that interfere with axonal 
transport or cytoskeletal function often produce periph-eral neuropathies. The longest axons are most suscepti-ble, so the resulting clinical presentation is often most pronounced in the distal extremities. - Peripheral nerves are often damaged in many different 
forms of systemic vasculitis (Fig. 21–2, B) (Chapter 
9.

, including polyarteritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss syn-drome, and Wegener granulomatosis. Overall, periph -
eral nerve damage is seen in about a third of all patients with vasculitis at the time of presentation. The most common clinical picture is that of mononeuritis multiplex 
with a painful asymmetric mixed sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy.

Patchy involvement also is apparent at the microscopic level, as single nerves may show considerable interfascicular variation in the degree of axonal damage (Fig. 21–2, C). - Inherited diseases of peripheral nerves are a heterogeneous 
but relatively common group of disorders, with a preva -
lence of 1 to 4 in 10,000. They can be demyelinating or axonal. Most such disorders manifest in adulthood and follow a slowly progressive course that may mimic that of acquired polyneuropathies.

The most common cause is mutations in the PMP22 gene, which encodes a 
protein that is a component of the myelin sheath.

shown. Such interfascicular variation in axonal density often is seen in neuropathies resulting from vascular injury.

SUMMARY
Peripheral Neuropathies
- Peripheral neuropathies may result in weakness and/or 
sensory deficits and may be symmetric or consist of 
random involvement of individual nerves. - Axonal and demyelinating peripheral neuropathies can be 
distinguished on the basis of clinical and pathologic fea -
tures. Some disorders are associated with a mixed pattern of injury. - Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral 
neuropathy.

- Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic idiopathic demyelin -
ating polyneuropathy are immune-mediated demyelinating diseases that follow acute and chronic courses, respectively. - Metabolic diseases, drugs, toxins, connective tissue dis -
eases, vasculitides, and infections all can result in periph -
eral neuropathy. - A number of mutations cause peripheral neuropathy. Many of these are late-onset diseases that may mimic acquired ones.

stimulating calcium influx and the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholine diffuses across the synaptic cleft to bind its receptor on the postsynaptic 
membrane, leading to depolarization of the myofiber and contraction through electromechanical coupling. Often dis-orders of the neuromuscular junction produce functional abnormalities in the absence of any significant alterations in morphology beyond ultrastructural changes.

Consid-ered in this section are some of the more common or patho -
genically interesting disorders that disrupt the transmission of signals across the neuromuscular junction. Myasthenia Gravis
Myasthenia gravis is caused by autoantibodies that block the function of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors at motor end plates, which results in the degradation and depletion of the receptors.

The disease has an incidence of roughly 3 in 100,000 persons, can manifest at any age, and (like many autoimmune disorders) is more common in females. The disease can be transferred to animals with serum from affected patients, demonstrating the causal role of circulat -
ing anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies.

Some 60% of cases are associated with a peculiar reactive hyperplasia of intrathymic B cells (often referred to as thymic hyperpla -
sia), and another 20% are associated with thymoma, a tumor of thymic epithelial cells ( Chapter 11). These thymic 
lesions may perturb tolerance to self antigens, thereby setting the stage for the generation of autoreactive T and B cells.

Clinically, myasthenia gravis frequently manifests with 
ptosis (drooping eyelids) or diplopia (double vision) due 
to weakness in the extraocular muscles. This pattern of

widespread use as an antidote for wrinkles and a variety 
of other conditions associated with unwanted muscular 
activity (e.g., blepharospasm and strabismus).weakness is distinctly different from that in most primary myopathic processes, in which there is relative sparing of facial and extraocular muscles. The severity of the weak -
ness often fluctuates dramatically, sometimes over periods of only a few minutes.

Characteristically, repetitive use or electrophysiologic stimulation of muscles makes the weak -
ness more severe, whereas administration of cholinesterase inhibitors improves strength markedly; both of these fea -
tures are diagnostically useful. Effective treatments include cholinesterase inhibitory drugs, immunosuppression, 
plasmapheresis, and (in patients with thymic lesions) thy -
mectomy. These interventions have improved the 5-year survival rate to greater than 95%.

Lambert-Eaton Syndrome
Lambert-Eaton syndrome is caused by autoantibodies that inhibit the function of presynaptic calcium channels, which reduces the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. In contrast 
with those suffering from myasthenia gravis, patients with Lambert-Eaton syndrome experience improvement in weakness with repetitive stimulation. This serves to build up sufficient intracellular calcium to facilitate acetylcholine release.

Like myasthenia gravis, however, the disorder can be 
transferred to animals through the serum of affected patients. It often arises as a paraneoplastic disorder, par -
ticularly in patients with small cell lung carcinoma. Cho -
linesterase inhibitors are not effective, and therapy is therefore directed toward reducing the titer of causative antibodies, through either plasmapheresis or immunosup -
pression.

Owing to the strong link to lung cancer, the overall prognosis for patients with Lambert-Eaton syn -
drome is substantially worse than for those affected by myasthenia gravis. Miscellaneous Neuromuscular Junction Disorders
Several other neuromuscular junction disorders merit brief mention. - Congenital myasthenic syndromes comprise a heteroge -
neous group of genetic diseases that result from muta -
tions that disrupt the function of various neuromuscular junction proteins.

Depending on the affected protein, the defects can occur at the level of acetylcholine release (presynaptic), the transport of acetylcholine across the synaptic cleft (synaptic), or the responsiveness of skel -
etal muscle (postsynaptic), and may produce symptoms suggestive of Lambert-Eaton syndrome or myasthenia gravis. Some forms respond to treatment with acetylcho -
linesterase inhibitors. - Infections may be associated with defects in neural trans -
mission and muscle contraction.

Clostridium tetani and 
Clostridium botulinum (Chapter 8) both release extremely potent neurotoxins that interfere with neuromuscular transmission. Tetanus toxin (known as tetanospasmin) blocks the action of inhibitory neurons, leading to increased release of acetylcholine and sustained muscle contraction and spasm (tetanus). Botulinum toxin, by contrast, inhibits acetylcholine release, producing a flaccid paralysis.

The purified toxin (Botox) is remark -
ably stable after injection, an attribute that has led to its SUMMARY
Neuromuscular Junction Disorders
- Disorders of neuromuscular junctions manifest with 
weakness that often affects facial and extraocular muscles and may show marked fluctuation in severity.

- Both myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton syndrome, the 
most common forms, are immune-mediated, being caused by antibodies to postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors and presynaptic calcium channels, respectively. - Myasthenia gravis often is associated with th ymic hyper -
plasia or thymoma. Lambert-Eaton syndrome in a majority of cases is a paraneoplastic disorder; the strongest asso -
ciation is with small cell lung cancer.

- Genetic defects in neuromuscular junction proteins and 
bacterial toxins also can cause symptomatic disturbances in neuromuscular transmission. DISORDERS OF SKELETAL MUSCLE
Patterns of Skeletal Muscle Injury
Skeletal muscle consists of different fiber types broadly classified as slow twitch “aerobic” type I and fast twitch “anaerobic” type II fibers. They are normally distributed in checkerboard pattern ( Fig. 21–1, A).

Function of both types 
of fibers depends on the unique protein complexes that make up the sarcomeres and the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex ( Fig. 21–3), as well as enzymes that meet the 
special metabolic requirements of muscle. Primary muscle diseases or myopathies have to be distin -
guished from secondary neuropathic changes caused by dis -
orders that disrupt muscle innervation. Both are associated with altered muscle function and morphology, but each has distinctive features (Fig. 21–4).

Myopathic conditions are often associated with segmental necrosis and regenera -
tion of individual muscle fibers ( Fig. 21–4, B). As discussed 
later on, specific types of myopathies have additional mor -
phologic features, such as inflammatory infiltrates or intra -
cellular inclusions. Disruption of muscle by endomysial fibrosis and fatty replacement is a feature of disease 
chronicity associated with myopathic or neuropathic conditions.

Muscle fiber atrophy is shared by both neuropathic and 
myopathic processes. However, certain disorders are asso-ciated with particular patterns of atrophy, as follows:
- Neuropathic changes are characterized by fiber type grouping and grouped atrophy. Changes in muscle innervation result in larger groups of fibers that share the same fiber type with the resultant replacement of the normal checkerboard distribution by groups of fibers that are type I or II ( Fig. 21–4, D).

The presence of fewer 
but larger motor units and the segregation of innervated fibers results in groups of atrophic fibers ( Fig. 21–4, C). Remarkably, the fiber type of myofibers is not an

myopathies are a heterogeneous group of inherited diseases 
that often have a perinatal or early childhood presentation and result in relatively static deficits. The following discussion of the muscular dystrophies 
follows a long-standing classification that is based on inheritance patterns and clinical features.

Of note, however, the classification of the muscular dystrophies is evolving based on new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of these disorders and genotype-phenotype relationships. For example, mutations in several different genes present as autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, whereas different mutations in a single gene (such as dys -
trophin) can lead to two very different clinical phenotypes, the Duchenne and Becker types of muscular dystrophy.

Dystrophinopathies: Duchenne and Becker 
Muscular Dystrophy
Dystrophinopathies are the most common form of muscu -
lar dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are the two most 
important disease manifestations linked to mutations in the dystrophin gene. Duchenne muscular dystrophy has an incidence of about 1 per 3500 live male births and follows an inexorable fatal course.

DMD becomes clinically evident by the age of 5 years; most patients are wheelchair-bound by the time they are teenagers and dead of their disease by early adulthood. The Becker type of muscular dystrophy is less common and much less severe. inherent feature, but is dictated by the innervating motor neuron. Thus, if injury and regeneration of peripheral nerves alters muscle innervation, it will change the dis -
tribution of type I and type II myofibers.

Degeneration and regeneration of individual fibers and inflammatory infiltrates usually are absent in skeletal muscle disorders caused by abnormal innervation. - Prolonged disuse of muscles due to any cause (e.g., pro -
longed bed rest in the sick, casting of a broken bone) can cause focal or generalized muscle atrophy, which tends to affect type II fibers more than type I fibers.

- Glucocorticoid exposure, whether exogenous or endoge-
nous (e.g., in Cushing syndrome), also can cause muscle atrophy. Proximal muscles and type II myofibers are affected preferentially by these agents. Inherited Disorders of Skeletal Muscle
Genetic disorders affecting skeletal muscle include muscu-
lar dystrophies, congenital muscular dystrophies, and congenital myopathies.

Muscular dystrophies are inherited diseases that 
result in progressive muscle injury in patients who usually appear normal at birth. Congenital muscular dystrophies are 
progressive, early-onset diseases. Some are also associated with central nervous system manifestations. Congenital Figure 21–3 The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC).

This 
complex of glycoproteins serves to couple the cell membrane (the sar -
colemma) to the extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin-2 and the 
intracellular cytoskeleton.

One key set of connections is made by dystro -
phin, a scaffolding protein that tethers the myofibrillar cytoskeleton to the transmembrane dystroglycans and sarcoglycans, and also binds com -
plexes containing dystrobrevin, syntrophin, neuronal nitric oxide synthe -
tase (n NOS), and caveolin, which participate in intracellular signaling 
pathways.

Mutations in dystrophin are associated with X-linked Du -
chenne and Becker muscular dystrophies; mutations in caveolin and the sarcoglycan proteins, with autosomal limb-girdle muscular dystrophies; and mutations in α
2-laminin (merosin), with a form of congenital muscular 
dystrophy.

MORPHOLOGY
The histologic alterations in skeletal muscles affected by 
DMD and BMD are similar, except that the changes are milder in BMD (Fig. 21–5). The hallmarks of these as well as other muscular dystrophies are ongoing myofiber necrosis and regeneration. Progressive replacement of muscle tissue by fibrosis and fat is the result of degeneration outpacing repair.

As a result of ongoing repair muscles typically show marked variation in myofiber size and abnormal internally placed nuclei. Both DMD and BMD also affect cardiac muscles, which show variable degrees of myofiber hypertro -
phy and interstitial fibrosis. PATHOGENESIS
Both DMD and BMD are caused by loss-of-function muta -
tions in the dystrophin gene located on the short arm of 
the X chromosome (Xp21).

Dystrophin is a very large protein 
(427 k D in molecular weight) found in skeletal and cardiac 
muscle, brain, and peripheral nerves; it is part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (Fig. 21–3). This complex stabilizes the muscle cell during contraction and may be involved in cell signaling through interaction with other pro-teins.

Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex defects are thought to make muscle cells vulnerable to transient membrane tears during contraction that lead to calcium influx, and may also disrupt intracellular signaling. The result is myofiber degen-eration that with time outpaces the capacity for repair. The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex also is important for cardiac muscle function; this explains why cardiomyopathy eventually develops in many patients.

The dystrophin gene spans roughly 2.4 megabases (about 
1% of the X chromosome), making it one of the largest 
human genes. Its enormous size may explain in part its vulner -
ability to sporadic mutations that disrupt dystrophin produc-tion.

The most common mutations are deletions, followed by frameshift and point mutations. Muscle biopsy specimens from patients with DMD show a complete absence of dys -
trophin, whereas patients with BMD have mutations that permit some dystrophin (albeit often a defective form) to be made; thus, the severity of the disease correlates with 
the degree of the dystrophin deficiency.

Clinical Features
Often the first symptoms of DMD are clumsiness and an inability to keep up with peers due to muscle weakness. The weakness typically begins in the pelvic girdle and next involves the shoulder girdle. Enlargement of the calf muscles, termed pseudohypertrophy, is an important early physical finding.

The increased muscle bulk initially stems from myofiber hypertrophy, but as myofibers progres -
sively degenerate, an increasing part of the muscle is replaced by adipose tissue and endomysial fibrosis. Cardiac muscle damage and fibrosis can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias, which may prove fatal. Although no struc -
tural abnormalities in the central nervous system have been described, cognitive impairment is also sometimes seen and may be severe enough to manifest as mental retardation.

Owing to ongoing muscle degeneration, high serum creatine kinase levels are present at birth and 
persist through the first decade of life but fall as muscle mass is lost during disease progression. Death results 
from respiratory insufficiency, pneumonia, and cardiac decompensation. BMD becomes symptomatic later in childhood or ado -
lescence and progresses at a slower and more variable rate. Many patients live well into adulthood and have a nearly normal life span.

Cardiac involvement can be the dominant

clinical feature and may result in death in the absence of 
significant skeletal muscle weakness. Other X-Linked and Autosomal Muscular Dystrophies
Other forms of muscular dystrophy share some features with DMD and BMD but have distinct clinical, genetic, and pathologic features. - Myotonic dystrophy. Myotonia, the sustained involuntary contraction of a group of muscles, is the cardinal neuro -
muscular symptom in myotonic dystrophy.

Patients often complain of stiffness and difficulty releasing their grip, for instance, after a handshake. Myotonic dystro -
phy is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. More than 95% of patients with myotonic dystrophy have mutations in the gene that encodes the dystrophia myo -
tonica protein kinase (DMPK). In normal subjects, this gene contains fewer than 30 repeats of the sequence CTG, whereas in severely affected persons, several thou-sand repeats may be present.

Myotonic dystrophy thus falls into the group of disorders associated with trinu -
cleotide repeat expansions (Chapter 6). As is the case with other disorders with similar mutations, myotonic dystrophy exhibits the phenomenon of anticipation, char-
acterized by worsening of the disease manifestations with each passing generation due to further trinucleo -
tide repeat expansion.

The CTG repeat expansion is located in the 3 ′ untranslated region of the DMPK 
m RNA, and the manner in which it produces disease is unclear. The disease often manifests in late childhood with gait abnormalities due to weakness of foot dorsi -
flexors, with subsequent progression to weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the hands and wrist extensors, atrophy of the facial muscles, and ptosis.

Other tissues may also be affected, presenting as cardiac arrhythmias, cataracts, early frontal balding, endocrinopathies, and testicular atrophy. - Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies. These autosomal mus-cular dystrophies preferentially affect the proximal mus -
culature of the trunk and limbs. The genetic basis for these is heterogeneous. The growing list includes at least 6 dominant subtypes and 12 autosomal recessive sub -
types.

Some of the responsible mutations affect compo -
nents of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex other than dystrophin. Others affect proteins involved in vesicle transport and repair of cell membrane after injury (caveolin-3 and dysferlin), cytoskeletal proteins, 
or posttranslational modification of dystro glycan, a 
component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.

- Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EMD) is a rare but 
fascinating disorder caused by mutations affecting structural proteins found in the nucleus. An X-linked form results from mutations in the gene encoding the protein emerin, while an autosomal dominant form is caused by mutations in the gene encoding lamin A/C.

It is hypothesized that defects in these proteins compro -
mise the structural integrity of the nucleus in cells that are subjected to repetitive mechanical stress (e.g., cardiac and skeletal muscle). These proteins also may regulate chromatin structure. The clinical picture is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, contrac -
tures of the elbows and ankles, and cardiac disease.

The cardiac involvement is severe, being associated with car -
diomyopathy and arrhythmias that lead to sudden death in up to 40% of patients. - Fascioscapulohumeral dystrophy is an autosomal dominant form of muscular dystrophy that is usually associated with deletions in chromosomal region 4q35. The patho-physiologic relationship between this chromosomal

805 Disorders of Skeletal Muscle
Acquired Disorders of Skeletal Muscle
A diverse group of acquired disorders can manifest with 
muscle weakness, muscle cramping, or muscle pain. These include inflammatory myopathies, toxic muscle injuries, postinfectious rhabdomyolysis, and muscle infarction in 
the setting of diabetes. In most instances these are dis -
orders of adults with acute or subacute onsets.

Inflammatory Myopathies
Polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myosi -
tis are the most important primary inflammatory myopa -
thies. Other immune disorders (e.g., SLE, sarcoidosis) also can involve skeletal muscle. - Polymyositis is an autoimmune disorder associated with increased expression of MHC class I molecules on myofibers and predominantly endomysial inflamma-tory infiltrates containing CD8 + cytotoxic T cells.

The 
autoimmune attack leads to myofiber necrosis and sub -
sequent regeneration ( Fig. 21–6, A). Patients with poly -
myositis are often successfully treated with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. - Dermatomyositis is the most common inflammatory myopathy in children, in whom it appears as an isolated entity. In adults, it can manifest as a paraneoplastic dis -
order. In both contexts, it is believed to have an autoim -
mune basis.

On microscopic examination, it is associated with perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates, “dropout” of capillaries, the presence of so-called tubuloreticular inclusions in endothelial cells, and myofiber damage in a paraseptal or perifascicular pattern (Fig. 21–6, B). Type 
1 interferon-induced gene products are strongly upregu -
lated in affected muscles.

Some patients have autoanti -
bodies that are relatively specific for dermatomyositis; these include antibodies against Mi-2 (a nuclear heli -
case) and p155 and p140, proteins with uncertain functions. - Inclusion body myositis is the most common inflammatory 
myopathy in patients older than 60 years of age. It 
is lumped in with other forms of myositis, but it has yet to be determined whether inflammation is cause or effect in this disorder.

The morphologic hallmark of inclusion body myositis is the presence of rimmed vacu -
oles (Fig. 21–6, C) that contain aggregates of the same 
proteins that accumulate in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases—hyperphosphorylated tau, amyloid derived from β-amyloid precursor protein and 
TDP-43 (Chapter 20)—leading some to speculate that this is a degenerative disorder of aging.

Other features typical of chronic inflammatory myopathies, including myopathic changes, mononuclear cell infiltrates, endo -
mysial fibrosis, and fatty replacement, also are evident. The disease follows a chronic, progressive course and generally does not respond well to immunosuppressive agents, another feature suggesting that inflammation is a secondary event.

Toxic Myopathies
A number of insults can cause toxic muscle injury, includ-ing intrinsic factors (e.g., thyroxine) and extrinsic factors (e.g., acute alcohol intoxication, various drugs).defect and the disease phenotype is not known. Most patients become symptomatic by the age of 20 years, usually owing to weakness in the facial muscles and the shoulder. Patients also exhibit weakness in the lower trunk and the dorsiflexors of the foot. Most affected persons have a normal life expectancy.

Channelopathies, Metabolic Myopathies, 
and Mitochondrial Myopathies
Other important inherited disorders of skeletal muscle are the result of defects in ion channels (channelopathies), metabolism, and mitochondrial function. - Ion channel myopathies are a group of familial disorders 
characterized by myotonia, relapsing episodes of hypo -
tonic paralysis associated with abnormal serum potas -
sium levels, or both.

As implied by their name, these diseases stem from inherited defects in genes encoding ion channels. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis results from 
mutations in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle sodium channel protein SCN4A, which regulates sodium entry during contraction. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare 
syndrome characterized by a dramatic hypermetabolic state (tachycardia, tachypnea, muscle spasms, and finally hyperpyrexia).

It is triggered when patients car -
rying mutations in the ryanodine receptor, a calcium release channel protein, are given halogenated anes -
thetic agents or succinylcholine during surgery. Some of these patients also show features of a congenital myopa -
thy referred to as central core disease, so called because the center of the myofiber contains a collection of disor -
ganized myofibrils.

- Myopathies due to inborn errors of metabolism include 
disorders of glycogen synthesis and degradation (Chapter 6), and abnormalities in lipid handling. The latter include disorders of the carnitine transport system or deficiencies of the mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzyme system, both of which can lead to significant accumulation of lipid in myocytes (lipid myopathies). These storage disorders can manifest as systemic disease or result in a muscle-specific phenotype.

Some are 
associated with ongoing muscle damage and weakness. Others manifest with recurring episodes of massive exercise- or fasting-induced muscle damage, sometimes associated with acute renal failure and myoglobulinuria (rhabdomyolysis). - Mitochondrial myopathies can stem from mutations in 
either the mitochondrial or nuclear genomes, the latter because some mitochondrial enzymes are encoded in nuclear DNA. The forms caused by mitochondrial muta -
tions show maternal inheritance (Chapter 6).

Mitochon -
drial myopathies usually manifest in early adulthood with proximal muscle weakness and sometimes with severe involvement of the ocular musculature ( external 
ophthalmoplegia). There can also be neurologic signs and symptoms, lactic acidosis, and cardiomyopathy. Some mitochondrial diseases are associated with normal muscle morphology, whereas others show aggregates of abnormal mitochondria; the latter impart a blotchy red appearance in special stains—hence the term ragged red 
fibers.

On ultrastructural examination, these correspond to abnormal aggregates of mitochondria with abnormal shape and size, some containing paracrystalline parking 
lot inclusions.

PERIPHERAL NERVE SHEATH TUMORS
A number of different tumors arise from peripheral nerves. Such tumors may manifest as soft tissue masses or with pain or loss of function related to impingement on nerves or other surrounding structures. In most peripheral nerve tumors, the neoplastic cells show evidence of Schwann cell differentiation. These tumors usually occur in adults and include both benign and malignant variants.

An important feature is their frequent association with the familial tumor syndromes neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and neurofibro -
matosis type 2 (NF2). Tumors with skeletal muscle differ -
entiation also occur; these are discussed in Chapter 20, 
along with other tumors of soft tissues. Schwannomas and Neurofibromatosis T ype 2
Schwannomas are benign encapsulated tumors that may occur in soft tissues, internal organs, or spinal nerve roots.

The most commonly affected cranial nerve is the vestibular portion of the eighth nerve. Tumors arising in a nerve root or the vestibular nerve may be associated with symptoms related to nerve root compression, which includes hearing loss in the case of vestibular schwannomas. Most schwannomas are sporadic, but about 10% are 
associated with familial neurofibromatosis type 2.

NF2 patients are at risk of developing multiple schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas (the latter are described in Chapter 22). The presence of bilateral vestibular 
schwannomas is a hallmark of NF2. Affected patients carry a dominant loss of function mutation of the merlin gene on chromosome 22. Merlin is a cytoskeletal protein that func -
tions as a tumor suppressor by facilitating E-cadherin–mediated contact inhibition ( Chapter 5).

Of note, merlin 
expression is also disrupted in sporadic schwannomas. Despite the name of the syndrome, neurofibromas are not a feature of NF2. Schwannomatosis is a familial condition • Thyrotoxic myopathy may take the form of either acute or chronic proximal muscle weakness, and can be the first indication of thyrotoxicosis. Histologic findings include myofiber necrosis and regeneration. - Ethanol myopathy occurs after an episode of binge drink -
ing.

The degree of rhabdomyolysis may be severe, some -
times leading to acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. Patients usually complain of acute muscle pain, which may be generalized or confined to a single muscle group. Microscopically, there is myocyte swelling, necrosis, and regeneration. - Drug myopathy can be produced by a variety of agents. Currently the most commonly implicated drugs are those belonging to the statin family.

The affected muscles show evidence of myopathic injury, usually without an inflammatory component. Figure 21–6 Inflammatory myopathies. A, Polymyositis is characterized by endomysial inflammatory infiltrates and myofiber necrosis ( arrow). B, Dermatomyositis often shows prominent perifascicular and paraseptal atrophy.

SUMMARY
Disorders of Skeletal Muscle
- Skeletal muscle function can be impaired secondarily 
because of problems with muscle innervation or by a primary myopathy that can be inherited or acquired. - The genetic forms of myopathy fall into several fairly 
distinct clinical phenotypes, including muscular dystrophy, congenital myopathy, and congenital muscular dystrophy.

- Dystrophinopathies are X-linked disorders caused by 
mutations in the dystrophin gene and disruption of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Depending on the type of mutation the disease may be severe, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or mild (e.g., Becker dystrophy). - Acquired myopathies have diverse causes, including inflam -
mation and toxic exposures.

associated with multiple schwannomas in which vestibular 
schwannomas are absent. Some cases have recently been 
linked to loss-of-function mutations in a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes a protein that regu -
lates chromatin structure. MORPHOLOGY
On gross inspection, most schwannomas appear as circum -
scribed masses abutting an adjacent nerve.

On microscopic examination, these tumors often show an admixture of dense and loose areas referred to as Antoni A and B, respectively (Fig. 21–7, A and B). They are comprised of a uniform pro -
liferation of neoplastic Schwann cells. In the dense Antoni A areas, bland spindle cells with buckled nuclei are arranged into intersecting fascicles. These cells often align to produce nuclear palisading, resulting in alternating bands of nuclear and anuclear areas called Verocay bodies.

Axons are largely excluded from the tumor. Thick-walled hyalinized vessels often are present. Hemorrhage or cystic change are also seen sometimes. A B

Multiple nerve fascicles are expanded by infiltrating tumor cells (C), which at higher power (D) are seen 
to consist of bland spindle cells admixed with wavy collagen bundles likened to carrot shavings. Neurofibromas
Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Three important subtypes are recognized:
- Localized cutaneous neurofibromas arise as superficial nodular or polypoid tumors.

These occur either as soli -
tary sporadic lesions or as often multiple lesions in the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). - Plexiform neurofibromas grow diffusely within the con -
fines of a nerve or nerve plexus. Surgical enucleation of such lesions is therefore difficult and is often associated with lasting neurologic deficits. Plexiform neurofibro -
mas are virtually pathognomonic for NF1 (discussed later on).

Unlike other benign nerve sheath tumors, these tumors are associated with a small but real risk of malignant transformation. - Diffuse neurofibromas are infiltrative proliferations that can take the form of large, disfiguring subcutaneous masses. These also are often associated with NF1.

MORPHOLOGY
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors manifest as large, 
poorly defined soft tissue masses. On histologic examination, these tumors are highly cellular and exhibit features of overt malignancy, including anaplasia, necrosis, infiltrative growth pattern, pleomorphism, and high proliferative activity.

The low-power view often shows alternating areas of high and low cellularity that result in an appearance described as “marble-like.” Also frequently seen are perivascular areas of increased cellular density. Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath T umors
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are neoplasms seen in adults that typically show evidence of Schwann cell derivation and sometimes a clear origin from a peripheral nerve.

They may arise from transformation of a neurofi -
broma, usually of the plexiform type. About one half of such tumors arise in patients with NF1, and 3% to 10% of all patients with NF1 develop a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor during their lifetime. Neurofibromatosis T ype 1
NF1 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by muta -
tions in the tumor suppressor neurofibromin, encoded on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q).

Neurofibromin is a negative regulator of the potent oncoprotein Ras ( Chapter 
5. . Disruption of neurofibromin function and Ras hyperac -
tivity appear to be a cardinal feature of NF1-associated tumors. As would be anticipated for a tumor suppressor gene, the sole normal neurofibromin allele is mutated or silenced in tumors arising in the setting of NF1, which include neurofibromas of all three main types, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, optic gliomas, and other glial tumors.

In addition, patients with NF1 exhibit learn -
ing disabilities, seizures, skeletal abnormalities, vascular abnormalities with arterial stenoses, pigmented nodules of the iris (Lisch nodules), and pigmented skin lesions (axillary freckling and café au lait spots) in various degrees. SUMMARY
Peripheral Nerve Sheath T umors
- In most peripheral nerve sheath tumors, the neoplastic 
cells show evidence of Schwann cell differentiation.

- Peripheral nerve sheath tumors are important features of 
the familial tumor syndromes neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and type 2 (NF2). - Schwannomas and neurofibromas are benign nerve sheath 
tumors. - Schwannomas are circumscribed, usually encapsulated 
tumors that abut the nerve of origin and are a feature of NF2. - Neurofibromas may manifest as a sporadic subcutaneous 
nodule, as a large, poorly defined soft tissue lesion, or as a growth within a nerve. Neurofibromas are associated with NF1.

- About 50% of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors 
occur de novo in otherwise normal persons, while the remainder arise from the malignant transformation of a preexisting NF1-associated neurofibroma. MORPHOLOGY
Unlike schwannomas, neurofibromas are not encapsulated. They may appear circumscribed, as in localized cutaneous 
neurofibromas, or exhibit a diffuse infiltrative growth 
pattern.

Also in contrast with schwannomas, the neoplastic Schwann cells in neurofibroma are admixed with other cell types, including mast cells, fibroblast-like cells and perineurial-like cells. As a result, the cellular growth pattern of neurofi -
bromas is more haphazard than that of schwannomas. The background stroma often contains loose wavy collagen bundles but also can be myxoid or contain dense collagen (Fig. 21–7, D).

Plexiform neurofibromas involve multiple 
fascicles of individual affected nerves ( Fig. 21–7, C). Residual 
axons are found embedded within the diffuse neoplastic Schwann cell proliferation, which expand the fascicles while leaving the perineurium intact. Diffuse neurofibromas 
show an extensive infiltrative pattern of growth within the dermis and subcutis of the skin. T raumatic Neuroma
Traumatic neuroma is a non-neoplastic proliferation asso -
ciated with previous injury of a peripheral nerve.

Injuries that lead to the transection of axons activate a regenerative program (see Fig. 21–1) characterized by sprouting and 
elongation of processes from the proximal axonal stump. With severe injuries that disrupt the perineurial sheath, these new processes may “miss” their target, the distal end of the transected nerve.

The misguided elongating axonal processes can induce a reactive proliferation of Schwann cells, leading to the formation of a painful localized nodule that consists of a haphazard mixture of axons, Schwann cells, and connective tissue. BIBLIOGRAPHY

Degenerative, inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic dis -
orders of the central nervous system (CNS) are some of the 
most serious diseases of mankind.

The pathology of these diseases has many features that reflect the unique proper -
ties of the CNS. In fact, the diagnosis and analysis of CNS disorders requires specialized expertise, a realization that has led to the creation of the field of neuropathology. PATTERNS OF INJURY IN THE 
NERVOUS SYSTEM
The cells of the nervous system respond to various forms 
of injury with distinct morphologic changes. Central Nervous System
MORPHOLOGY
Features of Neuronal Injury.

In response to injury, a 
number of changes occur in neurons and their processes (axons and dendrites). Within 12 hours of an irreversible hypoxic-ischemic insult, acute neuronal injury becomes evident on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Fig. 22–1, A). There is shrinkage of the cell body, pyknosis of the 
nucleus, disappearance of the nucleolus, and loss of Nissl substance, with intense eosinophilia of the cytoplasm (“red neurons”).

Often, the nucleus assumes the angulated shape of the shrunken cell body. Injured axons undergo swelling and show disruption of axonal transport. The swellings (spher -
oids) can be recognized on H&E stains ( Fig. 22–1, B) and can 
be highlighted by silver staining or immunohistochemistry. Axonal injury also leads to cell body enlargement and round -
ing, peripheral displacement of the nucleus, enlargement of the nucleolus, and peripheral dispersion of Nissl substance (central chromatolysis) (Fig.

22–1, C). In addition, acute 
injuries typically result in breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and variable degrees of cerebral edema (described later). Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with spe -
cific intracellular inclusions (e.g., Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease and tangles in Alzheimer disease), also described later. Pathogenic viruses can also form inclusions in neurons, just as they do in other cells of the body.

In some neurode -
generative diseases, neuronal processes also become thick -
ened and tortuous; these are termed dystrophic neurites. With age, neurons also accumulate complex lipids (lipofus-
cin) in their cytoplasm and lysosomes. Astrocytes in Injury and Repair. Astrocytes are the

EDEMA, HERNIATION, AND 
HYDROCEPHALUS
The brain and spinal cord exist within the protective and 
rigid skull and spinal canal, with nerves and blood vessels passing through specific foramina.

The advantage of housing the delicate CNS within such a protective environ -
ment is obvious, but this arrangement provides little room for brain parenchymal expansion in disease states. Disor -
ders that may cause dangerous increases in brain volume within the fixed space of the skull include generalized cere -
bral edema, hydrocephalus, and mass lesions such as tumors. Cerebral Edema
Cerebral edema is the accumulation of excess fluid within the brain parenchyma.

There are two types, which often occur together particularly after generalized injury. - Vasogenic edema occurs when the integrity of the normal 
blood-brain barrier is disrupted, allowing fluid to shift from the vascular compartment into the extracellular spaces of the brain. Vasogenic edema can be either local-ized (e.g., increased vascular permeability due to inflam-mation or in tumors) or generalized.

- Cytotoxic edema is an increase in intracellular fluid sec -
ondary to neuronal and glial cell membrane injury, as might follow generalized hypoxic-ischemic insult or after exposure to some toxins. The edematous brain is softer than normal and often appears to “over fill” the cranial vault. In generalized edema the gyri are flattened, the intervening sulci are 
narrowed, and the ventricular cavities are compressed 
(Fig. 22–2).

Hydrocephalus
After being produced by the choroid plexus within the ventricles, CSF circulates through the ventricular system brain, a process termed gliosis. In response to injury, astro -
cytes undergo both hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The nucleus enlarges and becomes vesicular, and the nucleolus becomes prominent. The previously scant cytoplasm expands and takes on a bright pink hue, and the cell extends multiple 
stout, ramifying processes (gemistocytic astrocyte).

Unlike elsewhere in the body, fibroblasts participate in healing after brain injury to a limited extent except in specific settings (penetrating brain trauma or around abscesses). In long-standing gliosis, the cytoplasm of reactive astrocytes shrinks in size and the cellular processes become more tightly 
interwoven (fibrillary astrocytes).

Rosenthal fibers are 
thick, elongated, brightly eosinophilic protein aggregates found in astrocytic processes in chronic gliosis and in some low-grade gliomas. Changes in Other Cell T ypes. Oligodendrocytes, 
which produce myelin, exhibit a limited spectrum of specific morphologic changes in response to various injuries. In pro -
gressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, viral inclusions can be seen in oligodendrocytes, with a smudgy, homogeneous-appearing enlarged nucleus.

Microglial cells are bone-marrow–derived cells that 
function as the resident phagocytes of the CNS. When acti-vated by tissue injury, infection, or trauma, they proliferate and become more prominent histologically. Microglial cells take on the appearance of activated macrophages in areas 
of demyelination, organizing infarct, or hemorrhage; in 
other settings such as neurosyphilis or other infections, they develop elongated nuclei (rod cells).

Aggregates of elon-
gated microglial cells at sites of tissue injury are termed microglial nodules. Similar collections can be found congregating around and phagocytosing injured neurons (neuronophagia). Ependymal cells line the ventricular system and the 
central canal of the spinal cord. Certain pathogens, particu -
larly cytomegalovirus (CMV), can produce extensive ependy -
mal injury, with typical viral inclusions.

Choroid plexus is in 
continuity with the ependyma, and its specialized epithelial covering is responsible for the secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

813 Edema, Herniation, and Hydrocephalus
- Subfalcine (cingulate) herniation occurs when unilateral 
or asymmetric expansion of a cerebral hemisphere dis -
places the cingulate gyrus under the edge of falx. This may be associated with compression of the anterior cere-bral artery. - Transtentorial (uncinate) herniation occurs when the medial aspect of the temporal lobe is compressed against the free margin of the tentorium.

As the temporal lobe is displaced, the third cranial nerve is compromised, resulting in pupillary dilation and impaired ocular and flows through the foramina of Luschka and Magendie into the subarachnoid space, where it is absorbed by arach-noid granulations. The balance between rates of generation and resorption regulates CSF volume. Hydrocephalus refers to the accumulation of excessive 
CSF within the ventricular system.

This disorder most often is a consequence of impaired flow or resorption; over -
production of CSF, typically seen with tumors of the choroid plexus, only rarely causes hydrocephalus. If there is a localized obstacle to CSF flow within the ventricular system, then a portion of the ventricles enlarges while the remainder does not.

This pattern is referred to as noncom-
municating hydrocephalus and most commonly is caused by masses obstructing the foramen of Monro or compressing the cerebral aqueduct. In communicating hydrocephalus, the 
entire ventricular system is enlarged; it is usually caused by reduced CSF resorption. If hydrocephalus develops in infancy before closure of 
the cranial sutures, the head enlarges.

Once the sutures fuse, hydrocephalus causes ventricular expansion and increased intracranial pressure, but no change in head cir -
cumference (Fig. 22–3). In contrast with these states, in which increased CSF volume is the primary process, a 
compensatory increase in CSF volume can also follow the loss of brain parenchyma (hydrocephalus ex vacuo), as after infarcts or with degenerative diseases.

Herniation
When the volume of tissue and fluid inside the skull increases beyond the limit permitted by compression of veins and displacement of CSF, intracranial pressure rises. The cranial vault is subdivided by rigid dural folds (falx and tentorium), and a focal expansion of the brain dis -
places it in relation to these partitions. If the expansion is sufficiently large, herniation occurs.

Herniation often leads to “pinching” and vascular compromise of the compressed tissue, producing infarction, additional swelling, and further herniation. There are three main types of herniation (Fig. 22–4). Figure 22–2 Cerebral edema. The surfaces of the gyri are flattened as 
a result of compression of the expanding brain by the dura mater and 
inner surface of the skull. Such changes are associated with a dangerous increase in intracranial pressure. Figure 22–3

CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
Cerebrovascular diseases—the broad category of brain 
disorders caused by pathologic processes involving blood 
vessels—constitute a major cause of death in the developed world and are the most prevalent cause of neurologic mor-bidity. The three main pathogenic mechanisms are (1) thrombotic occlusion, (2) embolic occlusion, and (3) vascu -
lar rupture.

Stroke is the clinical designation applied to all 
of these conditions when symptoms begin acutely. Throm-bosis and embolism have similar consequences for the brain: loss of oxygen and metabolic substrates, resulting in infarction or ischemic injury of regions supplied by the affected vessel. Similar injury occurs globally when there is complete loss of perfusion, severe hypoxemia (e.g., hypo -
volemic shock), or profound hypoglycemia.

Hemorrhage accompanies rupture of vessels and leads to direct tissue damage as well as secondary ischemic injury. Traumatic vascular injury is discussed separately in the context of trauma. Hypoxia, Ischemia, and Infarction
The brain is a highly oxygen-dependent tissue that requires a continual supply of glucose and oxygen from the blood.

Although it constitutes no more than 2% of body weight, the brain receives 15% of the resting cardiac output and is responsible for 20% of total body oxygen consumption. Cerebral blood flow normally remains stable over a wide range of blood pressure and intracranial pressure because of autoregulation of vascular resistance.

The brain may be deprived of oxygen by two general mechanisms:
- Functional hypoxia, caused by a low partial pressure of oxygen (e.g., high altitude), impaired oxygen-carrying capacity (e.g., severe anemia, carbon monoxide poison -
ing), or inhibition of oxygen use by tissue (e.g., cyanide poisoning)
- Ischemia, either transient or permanent, due to tissue 
hypoperfusion, which can be caused by hypotension, vascular obstruction, or both
Global Cerebral Ischemia
Widespread ischemic-hypoxic injury can occur in the setting of severe systemic hypotension, usually when sys -
tolic pressures fall below 50 mm Hg, as in cardiac arrest, 
shock, and severe hypotension.

The clinical outcome varies with the severity and duration of the insult. When the insult is mild, there may be only a transient postischemic confusional state, with eventual complete recovery. Neurons are more susceptible to hypoxic injury than are glial cells, and the most susceptible neurons are the pyra -
midal cells of the hippocampus and neocortex and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum.

In some individuals, even mild or transient global ischemic insults may cause damage to these vulnerable areas. In severe global cerebral ischemia, widespread neuronal death occurs irrespective of regional vulnerability. Patients who survive often remain severely impaired neurologically and in a persistent vegetative state.

Other patients meet the clinical criteria for so-called brain death, including evidence of diffuse cortical injury (isoelectric, or “flat,” electroencephalogram) and brain movements on the side of the lesion (“blown pupil”). The posterior cerebral artery may also be compressed, resulting in ischemic injury to tissue supplied by that vessel, including the primary visual cortex.

If the amount of displaced temporal lobe is large enough, the pressure on the midbrain can compress the contralateral cerebral peduncle against the tentorium, resulting in hemiparesis ipsilateral to the side of the herniation (a so-called false localizing sign). The compression of the peduncle creates a deformation known as Kernohan’s notch. Progression of transtentorial herniation is often accompanied by linear or flame-shaped hemorrhages in the midbrain and pons, termed Duret hemorrhages (Fig.

22–5). These 
lesions usually occur in the midline and paramedian regions and are believed to be the result of tearing of penetrating veins and arteries supplying the upper brain stem. - Tonsillar herniation refers to displacement of the cerebel -
lar tonsils through the foramen magnum. This type of herniation is life-threatening, because it causes brain stem compression and compromises vital respiratory and cardiac centers in the medulla. Figure 22–5 Duret hemorrhage.

As mass effect displaces the brain 
downward, there is disruption of the vessels that enter the pons along 
the midline, leading to hemorrhage. SUMMARY
Edema, Herniation, and Hydrocephalus
- Cerebral edema is the accumulation of excess fluid within 
the brain parenchyma. Hydrocephalus is defined as an 
increase in CSF volume within all or part of the ventricular system.

- Increases in brain volume (as a result of increased CSF 
volume, edema, hemorrhage, or tumor) raise the pressure inside the fixed capacity of the skull. - Increases in pressure can damage the brain either by 
decreasing perfusion or by displacing tissue across dural partitions inside the skull or through openings in the skull (herniations).

stem damage, including absence of reflexes and respiratory 
drive. When patients with this form of irreversible injury 
are maintained on mechanical ventilation, the brain gradu-ally undergoes autolysis, resulting in the so-called “respi -
rator brain.”
MORPHOLOGY
In the setting of global ischemia, the brain is swollen, with wide gyri and narrowed sulci. The cut surface shows poor demarcation between gray and white matter.

The histopath -
ologic changes that accompany irreversible ischemic injury (infarction) are grouped into three categories. Early 
changes, occurring 12 to 24 hours after the insult, include acute neuronal cell change (red neurons) ( Fig. 22–1, A) 
characterized initially by microvacuolization, followed by cytoplasmic eosinophilia, and later nuclear pyknosis and kary -
orrhexis. Similar changes occur somewhat later in astrocytes and oligodendroglia.

After this, the reaction to tissue damage begins with infiltration by neutrophils ( Fig. 22–6, A). Sub-
acute changes, occurring at 24 hours to 2 weeks, include necrosis of tissue, influx of macrophages, vascular prolifera -
tion, and reactive gliosis ( Fig. 22–6, B). Repair, seen after 2 
weeks, is characterized by removal of all necrotic tissue, loss of organized CNS structure, and gliosis ( Fig. 22–6, C). The

distribution of neuronal loss and gliosis in the neocortex typi -
cally is uneven with preservation of some layers and devasta -
tion of others—a pattern termed pseudolaminar necrosis. Border zone (“watershed”) infarcts are wedge-
shaped areas of infarction that occur in regions of the brain 
and spinal cord that lie at the most distal portions of arterial territories. They are usually seen after hypotensive episodes.

In the cerebral hemispheres, the border zone between the anterior and the middle cerebral artery distributions is at greatest risk. Damage to this region produces a band of necrosis over the cerebral convexity a few centimeters lateral to the interhemispheric fissure. Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Cerebral arterial occlusion leads first to focal ischemia and then to infarction in the distribution of the compromised vessel.

The size, location, and shape of the infarct and the extent of tissue damage that results may be modified by collateral blood flow. Specifically, collateral flow through the circle of Willis or cortical-leptomeningeal anastomoses can limit damage in some regions. By contrast, there is little if any collateral flow to structures such as the thalamus, basal ganglia, and deep white matter, which are supplied by deep penetrating vessels.

CMORPHOLOGY
The macroscopic appearance of a nonhemorrhagic 
infarct evolves over time. During the first 6 hours the tissue 
is unchanged in appearance, but by 48 hours, the tissue becomes pale, soft, and swollen. From days 2 to 10, the brain turns gelatinous and friable, and the boundary between normal and abnormal tissue becomes more distinct as edema resolves in the adjacent viable tissue.

From day 10 to week 3, the tissue liquefies, eventually leaving a fluid-filled cavity lined by dark gray tissue, which gradually expands as dead tissue is resorbed (Fig. 22–7, C). Microscopically, the tissue reaction follows a characteristic 
sequence. After the first 12 hours, ischemic neuronal 
change (red neurons) ( Fig. 22–1, A) and cytotoxic and vaso -
genic edema predominate. Endothelial and glial cells, mainly astrocytes, swell, and myelinated fibers begin to disintegrate.

Up to 48 hours, there is some neutrophilic emigration, 
which is followed by mononuclear phagocytic cells during the ensuing 2 to 3 weeks. Macrophages containing myelin or 
red cell breakdown products may persist in the lesion for months to years. As the process of phagocytosis and liquefac -
tion proceeds, astrocytes at the edges of the lesion progres -
sively enlarge, divide, and develop a prominent network of cytoplasmic extensions.

After several months, the striking astrocytic nuclear 
and cytoplasmic enlargement regresses. In the wall of the 
Embolic infarctions are more common than infarctions 
due to thrombosis. Cardiac mural thrombi are a frequent 
source of emboli; myocardial dysfunction, valvular disease, and atrial fibrillation are important predisposing factors. Thromboemboli also arise in arteries, most often from ath -
eromatous plaques within the carotid arteries or aortic arch.

Other emboli of venous origin cross over to the arte -
rial circulation through cardiac defects and lodge in the brain (paradoxical embolism; see Chapter 3); these include 
thromboemboli from deep leg veins and fat emboli, usually following bone trauma. The territory of the middle cerebral artery, a direct extension of the internal carotid artery, is most frequently affected by embolic infarction. Emboli tend to lodge where vessels branch or in areas of stenosis, usually caused by atherosclerosis.

Thrombotic occlusions causing cerebral infarctions 
usually are superimposed on atherosclerotic plaques; common sites are the carotid bifurcation, the origin of the middle cerebral artery, and at either end of the basilar artery. These occlusions may be accompanied by antero -
grade extension, as well as thrombus fragmentation and distal embolization. Infarcts can be divided into two broad groups based on 
their macroscopic and corresponding radiologic appear -
ance (Fig. 22–7).

Nonhemorrhagic infarcts result from acute 
vascular occlusions and can be treated with thrombolytic therapies, especially if identified shortly after presentation. This approach is contraindicated in hemorrhagic infarcts, 
which result from reperfusion of ischemic tissue, either through collaterals or after dissolution of emboli, and often produce multiple, sometimes confluent petechial hemor-rhages (Fig. 22–7, A and B).

In the cerebral cortex, the cavity is delimited from the meninges and subarachnoid space by a gliotic layer of tissue, derived from the molecular layer of the

in distribution from those associated with hypertension. Specifically, CAA-associated hemorrhages often occur in 
the lobes of the cerebral cortex (lobar hemorrhages). Subarachnoid Hemorrhage and Saccular Aneurysms
The most frequent cause of clinically significant non- 
traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is rupture of a saccular 
(berry) aneurysm.

Hemorrhage into the subarachnoid space also may result from vascular malformation, trauma (usually associated with other signs of the injury), rupture of an intracerebral hemorrhage into the ventricular system, hematologic disturbances, and tumors. Rupture can occur at any time, but in about one third of 
cases it is associated with acute increases in intracranial pressure, such as with straining at stool or sexual orgasm.

Blood under arterial pressure is forced into the sub -
arachnoid space, and the patient is stricken with sudden, excruciating headache (classically described as “the worst headache I’ve ever had”) and rapidly loses consciousness. Between 25% and 50% of affected persons die from the first bleed, and recurrent bleeds are common in survivors. Not surprisingly, the prognosis worsens with each bleeding episode.

About 90% of saccular aneurysms occur in the anterior 
circulation near major arterial branch points ( Fig. 22–9); 
multiple aneurysms exist in 20% to 30% of cases. Although they are sometimes referred to as congenital, they are not 
present at birth but develop over time because of underly -
ing defects in the vessel media.

There is an increased risk of aneurysms in patients with autosomal dominant poly-cystic kidney disease (Chapter 13), as well as those with genetic disorders of extracellular matrix proteins. Overall, roughly 1.3% of aneurysms bleed per year, with the Intracranial Hemorrhage
Hemorrhages within the brain are associated with (1) hypertension and other diseases leading to vascular wall injury, (2) structural lesions such as arteriovenous and 
cavernous malformations, and (3) tumors.

Subarachnoid hemorrhages most commonly are caused by ruptured aneurysms but also occur with other vascular malforma -
tions. Subdural or epidural hemorrhages usually are asso -
ciated with trauma. Primary Brain Parenchymal Hemorrhage
Spontaneous (nontraumatic) intraparenchymal hemor -
rhages are most common in mid- to late adult life, with a peak incidence at about 60 years of age. Most are due to the rupture of a small intraparenchymal vessel.

Hyperten-sion is the leading underlying cause, and brain hemorrhage accounts for roughly 15% of deaths among persons with chronic hypertension. Intracerebral hemorrhage can be clinically devastating when it affects large portions of the brain or extends into the ventricular system; alternatively, it can affect small regions and be clinically silent. Hyper -
tensive intraparenchymal hemorrhages typically occur in the basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, and cerebellum ( Fig.

22–8), with the location and the size of the bleed determin -
ing its clinical manifestations. If the person survives the acute event, gradual resolution of the hematoma ensues, sometimes with considerable clinical improvement. Figure 22–8 Cerebral hemorrhage. Massive hypertensive hemorrhage 
rupturing into a lateral ventricle. MORPHOLOGY
Acute hemorrhages are characterized by extravasated blood, which compresses the adjacent parenchyma.

With time, hemorrhages are converted to a cavity with a brown, discol -
ored rim. On microscopic examination, early lesions consist of clotted blood surrounded by brain tissue showing anoxic neuronal and glial changes as well as edema. Eventually 
the edema resolves, pigment- and lipid-laden macrophages appear, and proliferation of reactive astrocytes becomes visible at the periphery of the lesion. The cellular events then follow the same time course observed after cerebral infarction. cortex.

The pia and arachnoid are not affected and do not contribute to the healing process. The microscopic picture and evolution of hemorrhagic 
infarction parallel those of ischemic infarction, with the addition of blood extravasation and resorption. In persons with coagulopathies, hemorrhagic infarcts may be associated with extensive intracerebral hematomas.

Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a disease in which amyloidogenic peptides, typically the same ones found in Alzheimer disease (discussed later), deposit in the walls of medium- and small-caliber meningeal and cortical vessels. The amyloid confers a rigid, pipelike appearance and stains with Congo red. Amyloid deposition weakens vessel walls and increases the risk of hemorrhages, which differ

MORPHOLOGY
An unruptured saccular aneurysm is a thin-walled outpouch -
ing of an artery ( Fig. 22–10). Beyond the neck of the aneu -
rysm, the muscular wall and intimal elastic lamina are absent, such that the aneurysm sac is lined only by thickened 
probability of rupture increasing nonlinearly with size. For 
example, aneurysms larger than 1 cm in diameter have a 
roughly 50% risk of bleeding per year.

In the early period after a subarachnoid hemorrhage, there is an additional risk of ischemic injury from vasospasm of other vessels. Healing and the attendant meningeal fibrosis and scarring sometimes obstruct CSF flow or disrupt CSF resorption, leading to hydrocephalus. In addition to saccular aneurysms, atherosclerotic, 
mycotic, traumatic, and dissecting aneurysms also occur intracranially.

The last three types (like saccular aneu-rysms) most often are found in the anterior circulation, whereas atherosclerotic aneurysms frequently are fusiform and most commonly involve the basilar artery. Nonsac -
cular aneurysms usually manifest with cerebral infarction due to vascular occlusion instead of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Vascular Malformations
Vascular malformations of the brain are classified into four principal types based on the nature of the abnormal vessels: arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), cavernous malforma-
tions, capillary telangiectasias, and venous angiomas. AVMs, 
the most common of these, affect males twice as frequently as females and most commonly manifest between the ages of 10 and 30 years with seizures, an intracerebral hemor-rhage, or a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Large AVMs occur-ring in the newborn period can lead to high-output congestive heart failure because of blood shunting from arteries to veins. The risk of bleeding makes AVM the most dangerous type of vascular malformation. Multiple AVMs can be seen in the setting of hereditary hemorrhagic telan-giectasia, an autosomal dominant condition often associ -
ated with mutations affecting the TGFβ pathway. A

location, lacunes can be silent clinically or cause signifi -
cant neurologic impairment. - Rupture of the small-caliber penetrating vessels may occur, 
leading to the development of small hemorrhages. In time, these hemorrhages resorb, leaving behind a 
slitlike cavity ( slit hemorrhage) surrounded by brownish 
discoloration. - Acute hypertensive encephalopathy most often is associated 
with sudden sustained rises in diastolic blood pressure 
to greater than 130 mm Hg.

It is characterized by 
increased intracranial pressure and global cerebral dys -
function, manifesting as headaches, confusion, vomit-ing, convulsions, and sometimes coma. Rapid therapeutic intervention to reduce the intracranial pressure is essen -
tial. Postmortem examination may show brain edema, with or without transtentorial or tonsillar herniation. Petechiae and fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles in the gray and white matter may be seen microscopically.

Vasculitis
A variety of inflammatory processes involving blood vessels may compromise blood flow and cause cerebral infarction. Infectious arteritis of small and large vessels was previously seen mainly in association with syphilis and tuberculosis, but is now more often caused by oppor -
tunistic infections (such as aspergillosis, herpes zoster, or CMV) arising in the setting of immunosuppression.

Some systemic forms of vasculitis, such as polyarteritis nodosa, may involve cerebral vessels and cause single or multiple infarcts throughout the brain. Primary angiitis of the CNS is 
a form of vasculitis involving multiple small to medium-sized parenchymal and subarachnoid vessels that is char -
acterized by chronic inflammation, multinucleate giant cells (with or without granuloma formation), and destruc-tion of vessel walls.

Affected persons present with a diffuse encephalopathy, often with cognitive dysfunction. Treat-ment consists of an appropriate regimen of immunosup -
pressive agents. Other Vascular Diseases
Hypertensive Cerebrovascular Disease
Hypertension causes hyaline arteriolar sclerosis of the deep 
penetrating arteries and arterioles that supply the basal ganglia, the hemispheric white matter, and the brain stem. Affected arteriolar walls are weakened and are more vul -
nerable to rupture.

In some instances, minute aneurysms (Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysms ) form in vessels less than 
300 µm in diameter. In addition to massive intracerebral 
hemorrhage (discussed earlier), several other pathologic brain processes are related to hypertension. - Lacunes or lacunar infarcts are small cavitary infarcts, just 
a few millimeters in size, found most commonly in 
the deep gray matter (basal ganglia and thalamus), the internal capsule, the deep white matter, and the pons.

They are caused by occlusion of a single penetrating branch of a large cerebral artery. Depending on their SUMMARY
Cerebrovascular Diseases
- Stroke is the clinical term for acute-onset neurologic defi -
cits resulting from hemorrhagic or obstructive vascular lesions. - Cerebral infarction follows loss of blood supply and can 
be widespread or focal, or affect regions with the least robust vascular supply (“watershed” infarcts).

- Focal cerebral infarcts are most commonly embolic; with 
subsequent dissolution of an embolism and reperfusion, a nonhemorrhagic infarct can become hemorrhagic. - Primary intraparenchymal hemorrhages typically are due 
to either hypertension (most commonly in white matter, deep gray matter, or posterior fossa contents) or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. - Spontaneous subarachnoid hemor rhage usually is caused 
by a structural vascular abnormality, such as an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.

vascular channels (Fig. 22–11). Microscopic examination shows enlarged blood vessels separated by gliotic tissue, often with evidence of previous hemorrhage. Some vessels can be recognized as arteries with duplicated and fragmented internal elastic lamina, while others show marked thickening or partial replacement of the media by hyalinized connective tissue.

Cavernous malformations consist of distended, loosely 
organized vascular channels with thin collagenized walls without intervening nervous tissue. They occur most often in the cerebellum, pons, and subcortical regions, and have a low blood flow without significant arteriovenous shunting. Foci of old hemorrhage, infarction, and calcification frequently sur -
round the abnormal vessels.

Capillary telangiectasias are microscopic foci of dilated 
thin-walled vascular channels separated by relatively normal brain parenchyma that occur most frequently in the pons. Venous angiomas (varices) consist of aggregates of ectatic venous channels. These latter two types of vascular malfor -
mation are unlikely to bleed or to cause symptoms, and most are incidental findings. Figure 22–11 Arteriovenous malformation.

CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM TRAUMA
Trauma to the brain and spinal cord is a significant cause 
of death and disability. The severity and site of injury affect the outcome: injury of several cubic centimeters of brain parenchyma may be clinically silent (if in the frontal lobe), severely disabling (spinal cord), or fatal (involving the brain stem). A blow to the head may be penetrating or blunt; it may 
cause an open or a closed injury.

The magnitude and distri -
bution of resulting traumatic brain lesions depend on the shape of the object causing the trauma, the force of impact, and whether the head is in motion at the time of injury. Severe brain damage can occur in the absence of external signs of head injury, and conversely, severe lacerations and even skull fractures do not necessarily indicate damage to the underlying brain. When the brain is damaged, the inju -
ries may involve the parenchyma, the vasculature, or both.

Recent evidence suggests that repetitive episodes of 
trauma (such as occurs in athletes participating in contact sports) can lead to later development of neurodegenerative processes. In addition to a long-recognized association of trauma with the risk of Alzheimer disease, a distinct form of trauma-associated degeneration has been described, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by 
a unique pattern of intraneuronal tau protein inclusions (described later).

T raumatic Parenchymal Injuries
When an object impacts the head, brain injury may occur at the site of impact—a coup injury—or opposite the site of 
impact on the other side of the brain—a contrecoup injury. Both coup and contrecoup lesions are contusions, with comparable gross and microscopic appearances. A contu-
sion is caused by rapid tissue displacement, disruption of vascular channels, and subsequent hemorrhage, tissue injury, and edema.

Since they are closest to the skull, the crests of the gyri are the part of the brain that is most sus-ceptible to traumatic injury. Contusions are common in regions of the brain overlying rough and irregular inner skull surfaces, such as the orbitofrontal regions and the temporal lobe tips. Penetration of the brain by a projectile such as a bullet or a skull fragment from a fracture causes a laceration, with tissue tearing, vascular disruption, and hemorrhage.

MORPHOLOGY
On cross-section, contusions are wedge-shaped, with the widest aspect closest to the point of impact ( Fig. 22–12, A). Within a few hours of injury, blood extravasates throughout the involved tissue, across the width of the cerebral cortex, and into the white matter and subarachnoid spaces.

Although functional effects are seen earlier, morphologic evidence of injury in the neuronal cell body (nuclear pyknosis, cytoplasmic eosinophilia, cellular disintegration) takes about 24 hours to appear. The inflammatory response to the injured tissue follows its usual course, with neutrophils preceding the appearance of macrophages. In contrast with ischemic lesions, in which the superficial layer of cortex may be preserved, trauma affects the superficial layers most severely.

B
Figure 22–12 Cerebral trauma. A, Acute contusions are present 
in both temporal lobes, with areas of hemorrhage and tissue disruption. B, Remote contusions, seen as discolored yellow areas, are present on 
the inferior frontal surface of this brain. Old traumatic lesions have a characteristic macroscopic 
appearance: They are depressed, retracted, yellowish brown 
patches involving the crests of gyri ( Fig. 22–12, B).

More 
extensive hemorrhagic regions of brain trauma give rise to larger cavitary lesions, which can resemble remote infarcts. In sites of old contusions, gliosis and residual hemosiderin-laden macrophages predominate. Although contusions are more easily seen, trauma can also 
cause more subtle but widespread injury to axons within the brain (called diffuse axonal injury), sometimes with dev -
astating consequences.

The movement of one region of brain relative to another is thought to disrupt axonal integrity and function. Angular acceleration, even in the absence of impact, may cause axonal injury as well as hemorrhage. As many as 50% of patients who develop coma shortly after trauma are believed to have white matter damage and diffuse axonal injury.

Although these injuries may be widespread, the lesions usually are asymmetric and are most commonly found near the angles of the lateral ventricles and in the brain stem. They take the form of axonal swellings that appear within hours of the injury. These are best demonstrated with silver stains or by immunohistochemical stains for axonal proteins.

Concussion describes reversible altered consciousness 
from head injury in the absence of contusion. The charac -
teristic transient neurologic dysfunction includes loss of 
consciousness, temporary respiratory arrest, and loss 
of reflexes. Although neurologic recovery is complete, amnesia for the event persists. The pathogenesis of the sudden disruption of nervous activity is unknown.

T raumatic Vascular Injury
CNS trauma often directly disrupts vessel walls, leading to hemorrhage. Depending on the affected vessel, the hemor -
rhage may be epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, or intraparen-
chymal (Fig. 22–13, A), occurring alone or in combination. Subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages most often occur at sites of contusions and lacerations. Epidural Hematoma

In children

(Fig. 22–13, B), producing a hematoma that compresses the 
brain surface. Clinically, patients can be lucid for several hours 
between the moment of trauma and the development of neuro -
logic signs.

Rapid movement of the brain during trauma can tear the bridging veins that extend from the cerebral hemispheres through the subarachnoid and subdural space to the dural sinuses. Their disruption produces bleeding into the sub-dural space.

In patients with brain atrophy, the bridging 
veins are stretched out, and the brain has additional space within which to move, accounting for the higher rate of subdural hema -
tomas in elderly persons. Infants also are susceptible to

SUMMARY
Central Nervous System T rauma
- Physical injury to the brain can occur when the inside of 
the skull comes into forceful contact with the brain. - In blunt trauma, if the head is mobile there may be brain 
injury both at the original point of contact (coup injury) 
and on the opposite side of the brain (contrecoup injury) owing to impacts with the skull.

- Rapid displacement of the head and brain can tear axons 
(diffuse axonal injury), often causing immediate severe, irreversible neurologic deficits. - T raumatic tearing of blood vessels leads to epidural hema -
toma, subdural hematoma, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. MORPHOLOGY
An acute subdural hematoma appears as a collection of freshly clotted blood apposed to the contour of the brain surface, without extension into the depths of sulci (Fig. 22–13, C).

The underlying brain is flattened, and the subarach -
noid space is often clear. Typically, venous bleeding is self-limited; breakdown and organization of the hematoma take place over time. Subdural hematomas organize by lysis of the clot (about 1 week), growth of granulation tissue from the dural surface into the hematoma (2 weeks), and fibrosis (1 to 3 months). Organized hematomas are attached to the dura, but not to the underlying arachnoid.

Fibrosing lesions may eventually retract, leaving only a thin layer of connective tissue (“subdural membranes”). Subdural hematomas com -
monly rebleed (resulting in chronic subdural hemato -
mas), presumably from the thin-walled vessels of the granulation tissue, leading to microscopic findings consistent with hemorrhages of varying age. Symptomatic subdural hematomas are treated by surgical removal of the blood and associated reactive tissue.

subdural hematomas because their bridging veins are 
thin-walled. Subdural hematomas typically become manifest within 
the first 48 hours after injury. They are most common over the lateral aspects of the cerebral hemispheres and may be bilateral. Neurologic signs are attributable to the pressure exerted on the adjacent brain. Symptoms may be localizing but more often are nonlocalizing, taking the form of 
headache, confusion, and slowly progressive neurologic deterioration.

CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS 
AND PERINATAL BRAIN INJURY
The incidence of CNS malformations, giving rise to mental retardation, cerebral palsy, or neural tube defects, is esti -
mated at 1% to 2%. Malformations of the brain are more common in the setting of multiple birth defects. Prenatal or perinatal insults may either interfere with normal CNS development or cause tissue damage.

Since different parts of the brain develop at different times during gesta -
tion, the timing of an injury will be reflected in the pattern of malformation; earlier events typically lead to more severe phenotypes. Mutations affecting genes that regulate the differentiation, maturation, or intercellular communi-cation of neurons or glial cells can cause CNS malformation or dysfunction. Additionally, various chemicals and infec -
tious agents have teratogenic effects.

Not all developmental disorders are characterized by 
specific, recognizable gross or microscopic findings, yet such disorders may nevertheless be associated with pro -
found neuronal dysfunction. Genetic underpinnings for various forms of autism have emerged recently; many of 
the implicated genes contribute to the development or maintenance of synaptic connections.

Similarly, Rett syn-
drome is an X-linked dominant disorder associated with mutations in the gene encoding methyl-Cp G–binding protein-2 (Me CP2), a regulator of epigenetic modifications of chromatin. Development in affected girls initially is normal, but neurologic deficits affecting cognition and movement appear by the age of 1 to 2 years, highlighting the importance of epigenetic processes in neuronal devel -
opment and synaptic plasticity.

Malformations
Neural Tube Defects
On of the earliest steps in brain development is the forma -
tion of the neural tube, which gives rise to the ventricular system, brain and spinal cord. Partial failure or reversal of neural tube closure may lead to one of several malforma-tions, each characterized by abnormalities involving some combination of neural tissue, meninges, and overlying bone or soft tissues. Collectively, neural tube defects consti-
tute the most frequent type of CNS malformation.

The overall recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies is 4% to 5%, suggesting a genetic component. Folate deficiency during the initial weeks of gestation also increases risk through uncertain mechanisms; of clinical importance, pre -
natal vitamins containing folate can reduce the risk of neural tube defects by up to 70%. The combination of imaging studies and maternal screening for elevated α-fetoprotein has increased the early detection of neural tube defects.

The most common defects involve the posterior end 
of the neural tube, from which the spinal cord forms. These can range from asymptomatic bony defects ( spina 
bifida occulta) to severe malformation consisting of a flat, disorganized segment of spinal cord associated with an overlying meningeal outpouching. Myelomeningocele is an 
extension of CNS tissue through a defect in the vertebral column that occurs most commonly in the lumbosacral region (Fig. 22–14).

Patients have motor and sensory defi -
cits in the lower extremities and problems with bowel and bladder control. The clinical problems derive from the abnormal spinal cord segment and often are compounded by infections extending from the thin or ulcerated overly -
ing skin. At the other end of the developing CNS, anencephaly is 
a malformation of the anterior end of the neural tube that leads to the absence of the brain and the top of skull. An

to a smooth-surfaced brain. The cortex is abnormally 
thickened and usually has only four layers. Many forms 
of lissencephaly are associated with defects in genes that control neuronal migration. - Polymicrogyria is characterized by an increased number of irregularly formed gyri that result in a bumpy or cobblestone-like surface. These changes can be focal or widespread.

The normal cortical architecture can be altered in various ways, and adjacent gyri often show fusion of the superficial molecular layer. - Holoprosencephaly is characterized by a disruption of the normal midline patterning. Mild forms may just show absence of the olfactory bulbs and related structures (arrhinencephaly). In severe forms the brain is not divided into hemispheres or lobes, and this anomaly may be associated with facial midline defects such as cyclopia.

Holoprosencephaly as well as polymicrogyria can be the result of acquired or genetically determined disruption of normal development. Several single-gene defects including mutations in sonic hedgehog have been linked to holoprosencephaly. - Other examples are focally disordered cortex (confus -
ingly called dysplastic cortex) and neurons stranded 
beneath the cortex, sometimes as nodules and other times as bands.

Posterior Fossa Anomalies
The most common malformations in this region of the brain result in misplacement or absence of portions of the cerebellum. The Arnold-Chiari malformation (Chiari type II 
malformation) combines a small posterior fossa with a mis -
shapen midline cerebellum and downward extension of the vermis through the foramen magnum; hydrocephalus and a lumbar myelomeningocele typically are also present.

The far milder Chiari type I malformation has low-lying cer -
ebellar tonsils that extend through the foramen magnum. Excess tissue in the foramen magnum results in partial obstruction of CSF flow and compression of the medulla, with symptoms of headache or cranial nerve deficits often manifesting only in adult life. Surgical intervention can alleviate the symptoms.

Syndromes characterized by “missing” cerebellar tissue 
include Dandy-Walker malformation, characterized by an 
enlarged posterior fossa, absence of the cerebellar vermis, and a large midline cyst, and Joubert syndrome, in which 
there is absence of the vermis and brain stem abnormalities resulting in eye movement problems and disrupted respi -
ratory patterns. A range of recessive genetic lesions have been found to cause Joubert syndrome, with many involv -
ing alterations of the primary cilium.

Spinal Cord Abnormalities
In addition to neural tube defects, structural alterations of the spinal cord can occur that are not associated with abnormalities of the bony spine or overlying skin. These include expansions of the ependyma-lined central canal of the cord ( hydromyelia) or development of fluid-filled cleft -
like cavities in the inner portion of the cord ( syringomyelia, 
syrinx). These lesions are surrounded by dense reactive gliosis, often with Rosenthal fibers.

A syrinx also may develop after trauma or with intramedullary spinal tumors.encephalocele is a diverticulum of malformed CNS tissue extending through a defect in the cranium. It most often involves the occipital region or the posterior fossa. When it occurs anteriorly, brain tissue can extend into the sinuses. Forebrain Malformations
In certain malformations, the volume of the brain is 
abnormally large ( megalencephaly) or small ( microencephaly).

Microencephaly, by far the more common of the two, usually is associated with a small head as well (micro -
cephaly). It has a wide range of associations, including chromosome abnormalities, fetal alcohol syndrome, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection acquired in utero. The unifying feature is decreased gen -
eration of neurons destined for the cerebral cortex.

During the early stages of brain development, as progenitor cells proliferate in the subependymal zone, the balance between cells leaving the progenitor population to begin migration to the cortex and those remaining in the proliferating pool affects the overall number of neurons and glial cells gener -
ated. If too many cells leave the progenitor pool prema -
turely, there is inadequate generation of mature neurons, leading to a small brain.

Disruption of neuronal migration and differentiation 
during development can lead to abnormalities of gyration and the six-layered neocortical architecture, often taking the form of neurons ending up in the wrong anatomic 
location. Various mutations in genes that control migra -
tion result in these malformations, which include the following:
- Lissencephaly (agyria) or, with more patchy involvement, pachygyria, is characterized by absent gyration leading Figure 22–14 Myelomeningocele.

Both meninges and spinal cord 
parenchyma are included in the cystlike structure visible just above the

INFECTIONS OF THE NERVOUS 
SYSTEM
The brain and its coverings, as with all other parts of the 
body, can be sites of infections. Some infectious agents have a relative or absolute predilection for the nervous system (e.g., rabies), while others can affect many other organs as well as the brain (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus).

Damage to nervous tissue may be the consequence of direct injury of neurons or glial cells by the infectious agent or microbial toxins, or may be a consequence of the host innate or adaptive immune response. Infectious agents may reach the nervous system through 
several routes of entry:
- Hematogenous spread by way of the arterial blood supply is the most common means of entry.

There can also be retrograde venous spread, through the anastomoses between veins of the face and the venous sinuses of the skull. - Direct implantation of microorganisms is almost invari-ably due to traumatic introduction of foreign material. In rare cases it can be iatrogenic, as when microbes are introduced with a lumbar puncture needle. - Local extension can occur with infections of the skull or spine.

Sources include air sinuses, most often 
the mastoid or frontal; infected teeth; cranial or spinal osteomyelitis; and congenital malformations, such as meningomyelocele. - Peripheral nerves also may serve as paths of entry for a 
few pathogens—in particular, viruses such as the rabies and herpes zoster viruses. Epidural and Subdural Infections
The epidural and subdural spaces can be involved by bac -
terial or fungal infections, usually as a consequence of direct local spread.

Epidural abscesses arise from an adjacent 
focus of infection, such as sinusitis or osteomyelitis. When abscesses occur in the spinal epidural space, they may cause spinal cord compression and constitute a neurosurgi -
cal emergency. Infections of the skull or air sinuses may also spread to the subdural space, producing subdural 
empyema. The underlying arachnoid and subarachnoid spaces usually are unaffected, but a large subdural empyema may produce a mass effect.

In addition, throm -
bophlebitis may develop in the bridging veins that cross the subdural space, resulting in venous occlusion and infarction of the brain. Most patients are febrile, with head -
ache and neck stiffness, and if untreated may develop focal Perinatal Brain Injury
A variety of exogenous factors can injure the developing brain.

Injuries that occur early in gestation may destroy brain tissue without evoking reactive changes, sometimes making them difficult to distinguish from malformations. Brain injury occurring in the perinatal period is an impor -
tant cause of childhood neurologic disability. Cerebral palsy is a term for nonprogressive neurologic motor deficits char -
acterized by spasticity, dystonia, ataxia or athetosis, and paresis attributable to injury occurring during the prenatal and perinatal periods.

Signs and symptoms may not be apparent at birth and only declare themselves later, well after the causal event. The two major types of injury that occur in the perinatal 
period are hemorrhages and infarcts. These differ from the otherwise similar lesions in adults in terms of their loca -
tions and the tissue reactions they engender.

In premature infants, there is an increased risk of intraparenchymal hemor-
rhage within the germinal matrix, most often adjacent to the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle. Hemorrhages may extend into the ventricular system and from there to the subarachnoid space, sometimes causing hydrocephalus. Infarcts may occur in the supratentorial periventricular white matter (periventricular leukomalacia), especially in pre-mature babies.

The residua of these infarcts are chalky yellow plaques consisting of discrete regions of white matter necrosis and mineralization ( Fig. 22–15). When 
severe enough to involve the gray and white matter, large cystic lesions can develop throughout the hemispheres, a condition termed multicystic encephalopathy. Figure 22–15 Perinatal brain injury.

This specimen from a patient with 
periventricular leukomalacia contains a central focus of white matter 
necrosis with a peripheral rim of mineralized axonal processes. SUMMARY
Congenital Malformations and Perinatal Brain Injury
- Malformations of the brain can occur because of genetic 
factors or external insults. - The developmental timing and position of the injury 
determine its pattern and characteristics.

- Various malformations stem from failure of neural tube 
closure, improper formation of neural structures, and 
altered neuronal migration. - Perinatal brain injury mostly takes one of two forms: 
(1) hemorrhage, often in the region of the germinal 
matrix with the risk of extension into the ventricular system; and (2) ischemic infarcts, leading to periventricular leukomalacia.

825 Infections of the Nervous System
Aseptic Meningitis (Viral Meningitis)
Aseptic meningitis is a clinical term for an illness comprising 
meningeal irritation, fever, and alterations in conscious -
ness of relatively acute onset. The clinical course is less fulminant than in pyogenic meningitis. In contrast to pyo -
genic meningitis, examination of the CSF often shows lym -
phocytosis, moderate protein elevation, and a normal glucose level. The disease typically is self-limiting.

It is believed to be of viral origin in most cases, but it is often difficult to identify the responsible virus. There are no 
distinctive macroscopic characteristics except for brain swelling, seen in only some instances. On microscopic examination, there is either no recognizable abnormality or a mild to moderate leptomeningeal lymphocytic infiltrate.neurologic signs referable to the site of the infection, leth-argy, and coma.

With treatment, including surgical drain -
age, resolution of the empyema occurs from the dural side; if resolution is complete, a thickened dura may be the only residual finding. With prompt treatment, complete recov-ery is usual. Meningitis
Meningitis is an inflammatory process involving the lepto -
meninges within the subarachnoid space; if the infection spreads into the underlying brain it is termed meningoen-
cephalitis.

Meningitis usually is caused by an infection, but chemical meningitis also may occur in response to a nonbac -
terial irritant introduced into the subarachnoid space. Infectious meningitis can be broadly divided into acute pyo-
genic (usually bacterial), aseptic (usually viral), and chronic 
(usually tuberculous, spirochetal, or cryptococcal) sub -
types. Examination of the CSF is often useful in distin -
guishing between various causes of meningitis.

Acute Pyogenic Meningitis (Bacterial Meningitis)
Many bacteria can cause acute pyogenic meningitis, but the most likely organisms vary with patient age. In neonates, common organisms are Escherichia coli and the group B 
streptococci; in adolescents and in young adults, Neisseria 
meningitidis is the most common pathogen; and in older individuals, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Listeria monocyto-
genes are more common.

In all age groups, patients typi-cally show systemic signs of infection along with meningeal irritation and neurologic impairment, including headache, photophobia, irritability, clouding of consciousness, and neck stiffness. Lumbar puncture reveals an increased pressure; 
examination of the CSF shows abundant neutrophils, elevated protein, and reduced glucose. Bacteria may be seen on a smear 
or can be cultured, sometimes a few hours before the neu -
trophils appear.

Untreated pyogenic meningitis is often fatal, but with prompt diagnosis and administration of appropriate antibiotics, many patients can be saved. MORPHOLOGY
In acute meningitis, an exudate is evident within the lepto -
meninges over the surface of the brain (Fig. 22–16, A). The 
meningeal vessels are engorged and prominent. From the areas of greatest accumulation, tracts of pus can be followed along blood vessels on the brain surface.

When the meningitis is fulminant, the inflammatory cells infiltrate the walls of the leptomeningeal veins and may spread into the substance of the brain (focal cerebritis), or the inflammation may extend to the ventricles, producing ventriculitis. On microscopic examination, neutrophils fill the entire subarachnoid space in severely affected areas or may be found predominantly around the leptomeningeal blood vessels in less severe cases.

In untreated meningitis, Gram stain reveals varying numbers of the causative organism. Bacterial meningitis may be associ-ated with abscesses in the brain ( Fig. 22–16, B), discussed 
later. Phlebitis also may lead to venous occlusion and hemor -
rhagic infarction of the underlying brain. If it is treated early, there may be little or no morphologic residuum. A

Parenchymal Infections
The entire gamut of infectious pathogens (viruses to para-
sites) can potentially infect the brain, often in characteristic patterns. In general, viral infections are diffuse, bacterial infections (when not associated with meningitis) are local -
ized, while other organisms produce mixed patterns. In immunosuppressed hosts, more widespread involvement with any agent is typical.

Brain Abscesses
Brain abscesses are nearly always caused by bacterial infec -
tions. These can arise by direct implantation of organisms, local extension from adjacent foci (mastoiditis, paranasal sinusitis), or hematogenous spread (usually from a primary site in the heart, lungs, or distal bones, or after tooth extrac -
tion).

Predisposing conditions include acute bacterial endocarditis, from which septic emboli are released that may produce multiple abscesses; cyanotic congenital heart disease, associated with a right-to-left shunt and loss of pulmonary filtration of organisms; and chronic pulmonary infections, as in bronchiectasis, which provide a source of microbes that spread hematogenously.

Abscesses are destructive lesions, and patients almost 
invariably present with progressive focal deficits as well as general signs related to increased intracranial pressure. The CSF white cell count and protein levels are usually high, while the glucose content tends to be normal. A systemic or local source of infection may be apparent or may have ceased to be symptomatic.

The increased intracranial pres -
sure and progressive herniation can be fatal, and abscess rupture can lead to ventriculitis, meningitis, and venous sinus thrombosis. Surgery and antibiotics reduce the oth -
erwise high mortality rate, with earlier intervention leading to better outcomes. Chronic Meningitis
Several pathogens, including mycobacteria and some 
spirochetes, are associated with chronic meningitis; infe c-
tions with these organisms also may involve the brain parenchyma.

Tuberculous Meningitis
Tuberculous meningitis usually manifests with general-ized signs and symptoms of headache, malaise, mental confusion, and vomiting. There is only a moderate increase in CSF cellularity, with mononuclear cells or a mixture of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells; the protein level is elevated, often strikingly so, and the glucose content typically is moderately reduced or normal.

Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis also may result in a well-circumscribed intraparenchymal mass ( tuberculoma), which 
may be associated with meningitis. Chronic tuberculous meningitis is a cause of arachnoid fibrosis, which may produce hydrocephalus. MORPHOLOGY
The subarachnoid space contains a gelatinous or fibrinous exudate, most often at the base of the brain, obliterating the cisterns and encasing cranial nerves. There may be discrete white granules scattered over the leptomeninges.

Arteries running through the subarachnoid space may show oblitera-
tive endarteritis with inflammatory infiltrates and marked intimal thickening. On microscopic examination there are mixtures of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. Florid cases show well-formed granulomas, often with caseous necrosis and giant cells, similar to the lesions of tuberculosis elsewhere. MORPHOLOGY
Abscesses are discrete lesions with central liquefactive 
necrosis and a surrounding fibrous capsule (Fig. 22–16, B).

On microscopic examination, the necrotic center is sur -
rounded by edema and granulation tissue, often with exuber -
ant vascularization. Outside the fibrous capsule is a zone of reactive gliosis. Spirochetal Infections
Neurosyphilis, a tertiary stage of syphilis, occurs in about 10% of persons with untreated Treponema pallidum infec-
tion. Patients with HIV infection are at increased risk for neurosyphilis, which often is more aggressive and severe in this setting.

The infection can produce chronic meningi -
tis (meningovascular neurosyphilis), usually involving the base of the brain, often with an obliterative endarteritis rich in plasma cells and lymphocytes. There can also be paren -
chymal involvement by spirochetes (paretic neurosyphilis), leading to neuronal loss and marked proliferation of rod-shaped microglial cells.

Clinically, this form of the disease causes an insidious progressive loss of mental and physical functions, mood alterations (including delusions of gran -
deur), and eventually severe dementia.

Tabes dorsalis is 
another form of neurosyphilis, resulting from damage to the sensory nerves in the dorsal roots that produces impaired joint position sense and ataxia (locomotor ataxia); loss of pain sensation, leading to skin and joint damage (Charcot joints); other sensory disturbances, particularly characteristic “lightning pains”; and the absence of deep tendon reflexes.

Neuroborreliosis represents involvement of the nervous 
system by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, the pathogen 
of Lyme disease. Neurologic signs and symptoms are highly variable and include aseptic meningitis, facial nerve palsies, mild encephalopathy, and polyneuropathies. Viral Encephalitis
Viral encephalitis is a parenchymal infection of the brain that is almost invariably associated with meningeal inflam -
mation (and therefore is better termed meningoencephalitis).

While different viruses may show varying patterns of injury, the most characteristic histologic features are peri -
vascular and parenchymal mononuclear cell infiltrates, microglial nodules, and neuronophagia ( Fig. 22–17, A and 
B). Certain viruses also form characteristic inclusion bodies. The nervous system is particularly susceptible to certain 
viruses such as rabies virus and poliovirus.

Some viruses infect specific CNS cell types, while others preferentially involve particular brain regions (such as the medial tem -
poral lobes, or the limbic system) that lie along the viral route of entry. Intrauterine viral infection may cause con-
genital malformations, as occurs with rubella. In addition to

direct infection of the nervous system, the CNS also can 
be injured by immune mechanisms after systemic viral 
infections. Arboviruses
Arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) are an important cause of epidemic encephalitis, especially in tropical regions of the world, and are capable of causing serious morbidity and high mortality.

Among the more commonly encountered types are Eastern and Western equine enceph -
alitis and West Nile virus infection. Patients develop gen -
eralized neurologic symptoms, such as seizures, confusion, delirium, and stupor or coma, as well as focal signs, such as reflex asymmetry and ocular palsies.

The CSF usually is colorless but with a slightly elevated pressure and an early neutrophilic pleocytosis that rapidly converts to a lympho -
cytosis; the protein level is elevated, but the glucose is normal. MORPHOLOGY
Arbovirus encephalitides produce a similar histopathologic picture. Characteristically, there is a perivascular lymphocytic 
meningoencephalitis (sometimes with neutrophils) ( Fig. 22–
17, A).

Multifocal gray and white matter necrosis is seen, 
often associated with neuronophagia, the phagocytosis of neuronal debris, as well as localized collections of microglia termed microglial nodules (Fig. 22–17, B). In severe cases 
there may be a necrotizing vasculitis with associated focal hemorrhages. Herpesviruses
HSV-1 encephalitis may occur in any age group but is most common in children and young adults.

It typically mani -
fests with alterations in mood, memory, and behavior, reflecting involvement of the frontal and temporal lobes. Recurrent HSV-1 encephalitis is sometimes associated with inherited mutations that interfere with Toll-like receptor signaling (specifically that of TLR-3), which has an impor -
tant role in antiviral defense. MORPHOLOGY
Herpes encephalitis starts in, and most severely involves, the inferior and medial regions of the temporal lobes and the

usually taking a few months. The disease manifests ini -
tially with nonspecific symptoms of malaise, headache, and 
fever. As the infection advances, the patient shows extraor -
dinary CNS excitability; the slightest touch is painful, with violent motor responses progressing to convulsions. Con -
tracture of the pharyngeal musculature may create an aver-sion to swallowing even water (hydrophobia).

Periods of mania and stupor progress to coma and eventually death, typically from respiratory failure. Human Immunodeficiency Virus
In the first 15 years or so after recognition of AIDS, neuro -
pathologic changes were demonstrated at postmortem examination in as many as 80% to 90% of cases, owing to direct effects of virus on the nervous system, opportunistic infections, and primary CNS lymphoma.

Introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has decreased the frequency of these secondary effects of HIV infection. However, cognitive dysfunction ranging from mild to full-blown dementia that is lumped under the umbrella term HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) continues to 
be a source of morbidity. The cognitive symptoms are believed to stem from HIV infection of microglial cells in the brain.

This leads to activation of innate immune responses, both in infected microglial cells and unaffected bystanders. The ensuing neuronal injury likely stems from a combination of cytokine-induced inflammation and toxic effects of HIV-derived proteins. Aseptic meningitis occurs within 1 to 2 weeks of onset 
of primary infection by HIV in about 10% of patients; anti -
bodies to HIV can be demonstrated, and the virus can be isolated from the CSF.

The few neuropathologic studies of the early and acute phases of symptomatic or asymptom-atic HIV invasion of the nervous system have shown mild lymphocytic meningitis, perivascular inflammation, and some myelin loss in the hemispheres. After the acute phase, an HIV encephalitis (HIVE) commonly can be found if affected persons come to autopsy. HSV-2 also affects the nervous system, usually in the 
form of meningitis in adults.

Disseminated severe encepha -
litis occurs in many neonates born by vaginal delivery to women with active primary HSV genital infections. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox during 
primary infection, usually without any evidence of neuro -
logic involvement. The virus establishes latent infection in neurons of dorsal root ganglia. Reactivation in adults mani-fests as a painful, vesicular skin eruption in the distribution of one or a few dermatomes (shingles).

This usually is a self-limited process, but there may be a persistent pain syndrome in the affected region ( postherpetic neuralgia). VZV also may cause a granulomatous arteritis that can lead to tissue infarcts. In immunosuppressed patients, acute herpes zoster encephalitis can occur. Inclusion bodies can be found in glial cells and neurons. Cytomegalovirus
CMV infects the nervous system in fetuses and immuno -
suppressed persons.

All cells within the CNS (neurons, glial cells, ependyma, and endothelium) are susceptible to infection. Intrauterine infection causes periventricular necrosis, followed later by microcephaly with periventricu -
lar calcification. When adults are infected, CMV produces a subacute encephalitis, again often most severe in the peri -
ventricular region. Lesions can be hemorrhagic and contain typical viral inclusion–bearing cells.

Poliovirus
Poliovirus is an enterovirus that most often causes a sub -
clinical or mild gastroenteritis; in a small fraction of cases, it secondarily invades the nervous system and damages motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem (paralytic poliomyelitis). With loss of motor neurons, it produces a flaccid paralysis with muscle wasting and hyporeflexia in the corresponding region of the body. In the acute disease, death can occur from paralysis of respiratory muscles.

Long after the infection has resolved, typically 25 to 35 years after the initial illness, a postpolio syndrome of progres-
sive weakness associated with decreased muscle bulk and pain can appear. The cause of this syndrome is unclear.

One hypothesis is that motor neurons that survive the initial insult sprout new nerve terminals to compensate for the death of their neighbors, and that over time the addi -
tional demands placed on these neurons leads to injury that diminishes function or causes cell death. Rabies Virus
Rabies is a severe encephalitic infection transmitted to humans from rabid animals, usually by a bite. Various mammals are natural reservoirs.

Exposure to some bat species, even without evidence of a bite, is also a risk factor. Virus enters the CNS by ascending along the peripheral nerves from the wound site, so the incubation period depends on the distance between the wound and the brain, MORPHOLOGY
HIV encephalitis is best characterized microscopically as a chronic inflammatory reaction with widely distributed infil -
trates of microglial nodules, sometimes with associated 
foci of tissue necrosis and reactive gliosis ( Fig.

22–17, D). The 
microglial nodules also are found in the vicinity of small blood vessels, which show abnormally prominent endothelial cells and perivascular foamy or pigment-laden macrophages. These changes occur especially in the subcortical white matter, diencephalon, and brain stem. An important compo -
nent of the microglial nodule is the macrophage-derived multinucleate giant cell.

In some cases, there is also a disorder of white matter characterized by multifocal or diffuse areas of myelin pallor with associated axonal swellings and gliosis. HIV is present in CD4 + mononuclear and multi -
nucleate macrophages and microglia. Polyomavirus and Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is caused by JC virus, a polyomavirus, which preferentially orbital gyri of the frontal lobes ( Fig. 22–17, C).

The infection 
is necrotizing and often hemorrhagic in the most severely affected regions. Perivascular inflammatory infiltrates usually are present, and large eosinophilic intranuclear viral inclusions (Cowdry type A bodies) can be found in both neurons and glial cells.

- Candida albicans usually produces multiple microab-
scesses, with or without granuloma formation. - Mucormycosis is the term used to describe rhinocerebral infections caused by several fungi belonging to the order Mucorales. It typically presents as an infection of the nasal cavity or sinuses of a diabetic patient with ketoaci -
dosis. It may spread to the brain through vascular inva -
sion or by direct extension through the cribriform plate.

The proclivity of Mucor to invade the brain directly sets it apart from other fungi, which tend to reach the brain by hematogenous dissemination from distant sites. - Aspergillus fumigatus tends to cause a distinctive pattern of widespread septic hemorrhagic infarctions because of its marked predilection for blood vessel wall invasion and subsequent thrombosis. - Cryptococcus neoformans can cause both meningitis and meningoencephalitis, often in the setting of immuno -
suppression.

It can be fulminant and fatal in as little as 2 weeks or may exhibit indolent behavior, evolving over months or years. The CSF may have few cells but ele -
vated protein, and the mucoid encapsulated yeasts can be visualized on India ink preparations. Extension into the brain follows vessels in the Virchow-Robin spaces. As organisms proliferate, these spaces expand, giving rise to a “soap bubble”–like appearance ( Fig. 22–19).

The 
diagnosis is usually established by a positive test for cryptococcal antigens in the CSF or the blood. In endemic areas, Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides 
immitis, and Blastomyces dermatitidis also can infect the 
CNS, especially in the setting of immunosuppression. Other Meningoencephalitides
While a wide range of other organisms can infect the nervous system and its covering, only three specific entities are considered here. Cerebral Toxoplasmosis.

Cerebral infection with the pro -
tozoan Toxoplasma gondii can occur in immunosuppressed 
adults or in newborns who acquire the organism trans -
placentally from a mother with an active infection. In adults, the clinical symptoms are subacute, evolving during a 1- or 2-week period, and may be both focal and diffuse.

Due to inflammation and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier at sites of infection, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies often show edema around lesions (so-called ring enhancing lesions). In new -
borns who are infected in utero, the infection classically produces the triad of chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and intracranial calcifications.

Understandably, the CNS abnor -
malities are most severe when the infection occurs early 
in gestation during critical stages of brain development. Necrosis of periventricular lesions gives rise to secondary calcifications as well as inflammation and gliosis, which can lead to obstruction of the aqueduct of Sylvius and hydrocephalus.infects oligodendrocytes, resulting in demyelination as these cells are injured and then die.

Most people show serologic evidence of exposure to JC virus during child -
hood, and it is believed that PML results from virus 
reactivation, as the disease is restricted to immunosup -
pressed persons. Patients develop focal and relentlessly progressive neurologic symptoms and signs, and imaging studies show extensive, often multifocal, ring-enhancing lesions in the hemispheric or cerebellar white matter.

MORPHOLOGY
The lesions are patchy, irregular, ill-defined areas of white matter destruction that enlarge as the disease progresses (Fig. 22–18). Each lesion is an area of demyelination, in the center of which are scattered lipid-laden macrophages and a reduced number of axons. At the edges of the lesion are greatly enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei whose chromatin is replaced by glassy-appearing amphophilic viral inclusions.

The virus also infects astrocytes, leading to bizarre giant forms with irregular, hyperchromatic, sometimes multiple nuclei that can be mistaken for tumor. A

mass lesion and can cause seizures. Symptoms can inten -
sify when the encysted organism dies, as happens after therapy. The organism is found within a cyst with a smooth 
lining. The body wall and hooklets from mouth parts are most commonly recognized.

If the encysted organism has died, there can be an intense inflammatory infiltrate in the surrounding brain, often including eosinophils, which may be associated with marked gliosis. Amebiasis. Amebic meningoencephalitis manifests with dif -
ferent clinical syndromes, depending on the responsible pathogen. Naegleria spp., associated with swimming in

end-stage infection by the tapeworm Tenia solium. If 
ingested larval organisms leave the lumen of the gastroin -
testinal tract, where they would otherwise develop into mature tapeworms, they encyst. Cysts can be found throughout the body but are common within the brain and Figure 22–19 Cryptococcal infection.

Prion Diseases
Prion diseases are a group of rare but fascinating disorders 
that include sporadic, familial, iatrogenic, and variant forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), as well as animal diseases such as scrapie in sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle (“mad cow disease”). Unlike in other infectious diseases, the agent in prion diseases is an abnormal form of a cellular protein.

This protein, termed prion protein (Pr P), may undergo a conformational change from its normal shape (Pr P
c) to an abnormal conformation 
called Pr Psc (sc for scrapie). Pr P normally is rich in α-helices, 
but Pr Psc has a high content of β-sheets, a characteristic 
that makes it resistant to proteolysis (hence an alternative term for the pathogenic form, Pr P
res—i.e., protease-
resistant).

More important, when Pr Psc physically interacts 
with Pr P molecules it induces them to also adopt the 
Pr Psc con formation ( Fig. 22–21), a property that accounts 
for the “infectious nature” of Pr Psc. Over time, this self-
amplifying process leads to the accumulation of a high burden of pathogenic Pr P
sc molecules in the brain.

Pr Pc also 
may change its conformation spontaneously (but at an MORPHOLOGY
The progression to death in CJD usually is so rapid that there is little, if any, macroscopic evidence of brain atrophy.

On microscopic examination, the pathognomonic finding is a spongiform transformation of the cerebral cortex and deep gray matter structures (caudate, putamen); 
this multifocal process results in the uneven formation of small, apparently empty, microscopic vacuoles of varying sizes within the neuropil and sometimes in the perikaryon of neurons (Fig. 22–22, A).

In advanced cases, there is severe 
neuronal loss, reactive gliosis, and sometimes expansion of the vacuolated areas into cystlike spaces (“status spongio -
sus”). No inflammatory infiltrate is present. Immunohisto -
chemical staining demonstrates the presence of proteinase K–resistant Pr P
sc in tissue, while western blotting of tissue 
extracts after partial protease digestion allows detection of diagnostic Pr P
sc.

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
Starting in 1995, cases of a CJD-like illness appeared in 
the United Kingdom.

The neuropathologic findings and molecular features of these new cases were similar to those of CJD, suggesting a close relationship between the two illnesses, yet this new disorder differed from typical CJD in several important respects: The disease affected young adults, behavioral disorders figured prominently in early disease stages, and the neurologic syndrome progressed more slowly than in other forms of CJD.

Multiple lines of evidence indicate that this new disease, termed variant 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (v CJD) is a consequence of expo -
sure to the prion disease of cattle, called bovine spongiform encephalopathy. There has now also been documentation of transmission by blood transfusion. This variant form has a similar pathologic appearance to that in other types of CJD, with spongiform change and absence of inflamma -
tion.

In v CJD, however, there are abundant cortical 
amyloid plaques, surrounded by the spongiform change (Fig. 22–22, B).extremely low rate), accounting for sporadic cases of prion disease (s CJD). Certain mutations in the gene encoding Pr P
c (PRNP) accelerate the rate of spontaneous conforma -
tional change; these variants are associated with early-onset familial forms of prion disease (f CJD).

Accumulation of Pr P
sc in neural tissue seems to be the cause of cell injury, 
but the mechanisms underlying the cytopathic changes and eventual neuronal death are still unknown. Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
CJD is a rapidly progressive dementing illness, with a typical duration from first onset of subtle changes in memory and behavior to death in only 7 months. It is spo -
radic in approximately 85% of cases and has a worldwide annual incidence of about 1 per million.

While commonly affecting persons older than 70 years of age, familial forms caused by mutations in PRNP may present in younger 
people. In keeping with the infectious nature of Pr P
sc, there 
are well-established cases of iatrogenic transmission by contaminated deep implantation electrodes and human growth hormone preparations.

oligodendrocyte; and (3) the specialized proteins and lipids 
are also different. Therefore, most diseases of CNS myelin do not involve the peripheral nerves to any significant extent, and vice versa. In general, diseases involving myelin are separated into 
two broad groups. - Demyelinating diseases of the CNS are acquired condi -
tions characterized by preferential damage to previously normal myelin.

The most common diseases in this group result from immune-mediated injury, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and related disorders. Other processes that can cause this type of disease include viral infection of oligodendrocytes, as in progressive multifocal leuko-encephalopathy (see earlier), and injury caused by drugs and other toxic agents. - By contrast, in dysmyelinating diseases, myelin is not 
formed properly or has abnormal turnover kinetics.

As would be expected, dysmyelinating diseases are associ -
ated with mutations that disrupt the function of proteins that are required for the formation of normal myelin sheaths. The other general term for these diseases is leukodystrophy. Multiple Sclerosis
MS is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder character-ized by distinct episodes of neurologic deficits, separated in time, 
attributable to white matter lesions that are separated in space.

It is the most common of the demyelinating disorders, having a prevalence of approximately 1 per 1000 persons in most of the United States and Europe. The disease may become clinically apparent at any age, although onset in childhood or after age 50 is relatively rare. Women are affected twice as often as men. In most patients with 
MS, the illness shows relapsing and remitting episodes 
of neurologic impairment.

The frequency of relapses tends to decrease during the course of the illness, but a steady neurologic deterioration is characteristic in a subset of patients. PRIMARY DISEASES OF MYELIN
Within the CNS, axons are tightly ensheathed by myelin, an electrical insulator that allows rapid propagation of neural impulses. Myelin consists of multiple layers of highly specialized, closely apposed plasma membranes that are assembled by oligodendrocytes.

Although myelin -
ated axons are present in all areas of the brain, they are the dominant component in the white matter; therefore, most diseases of myelin are primarily white matter disorders.

The myelin in peripheral nerves is similar to the myelin in the CNS but has several important differences: (1) periph-eral myelin is made by Schwann cells, not oligodendro -
cytes; (2) each Schwann cell in a peripheral nerve provides myelin for only one internode, while in the CNS, many internodes are created by processes coming from a single

Infections of the Nervous System
- Pathogens fr om viruses through parasites can infect the 
brain; in addition, prion disease is a protein-induced trans -
missible disease unique to the nervous system. - Different pathogens use distinct routes to reach the brain, 
and cause different patterns of disease.

- Bacterial inf ections may cause meningitis, cerebral 
abscesses, or a chronic meningoencephalitis. - Viral infections can cause meningitis or meningoen -
cephalitis. - HIV can directly cause meningoencephalitis, or indirectly 
affect the brain by increasing the risk of opportunistic infections (toxoplasmosis, CMV) or CNS lymphoma. - Prion diseases are transmitted by an altered form of a 
normal cellular protein. They can be sporadic, transmitted, or inherited.

833 Primary Diseases of Myelin
MORPHOLOGY
MS is primarily a white matter disease with affected areas 
showing multiple, well-circumscribed, slightly depressed, glassy-appearing, gray-tan, irregularly shaped lesions termed plaques (Fig. 22–23, A). These commonly arise near the 
ventricles. They also are frequent in the optic nerves and chiasm, brain stem, ascending and descending fiber tracts, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The lesions have sharply 
defined borders at the microscopic level ( Fig.

22–23, B). In 
an active plaque there is evidence of ongoing myelin break -
down with abundant macrophages containing myelin debris. Lymphocytes and macrophages are present, mostly as peri -
vascular cuffs. Small active lesions often are centered on small veins. Axons are relatively preserved but may be reduced in number. Active plaques fall into four classes, only one of which 
typically is seen in a particular affected patient.

The recog-nized microscopic patterns are type I, which has macro -
phage infiltrates with sharp margins; type II, which is similar 
to type I but also shows complement deposition (suggesting

an antibody-mediated component); type III, with less well-
defined borders and oligodendrocyte apoptosis; and type 
IV, with nonapoptotic oligodendrocyte loss. When plaques 
become quiescent (inactive plaques), the inflammation 
mostly disappears, leaving behind little to no myelin. Instead, astrocytic proliferation and gliosis are prominent.

Clinical Features
The course of MS is variable, but commonly there are mul -
tiple relapses followed by episodes of remission; typically, 
recovery during remissions is not complete. As a conse -
quence, over time there is usually a gradual, often step -
wise, accumulation of neurologic deficits.

Imaging studies PATHOGENESIS
It is believed that MS, like other autoimmune diseases, is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors that result in a loss of tolerance to self proteins (in this case, myelin antigens). The nature of the initiating agent, often suggested to be an infectious agent, remains uncertain. Many lines of evidence indicate a significant contribution of genetic factors to the risk of developing MS.

The disease risk is 15-fold higher when the disease is present in a first-degree relative, and the concordance rate for monozygotic twins is approximately 25%, with a much lower rate for dizygotic twins. A significant fraction of the genetic risk for MS is attrib -
utable to HLA-DR variants, the DR2 allele being the one that most significantly increases the risk for developing MS. Many other genetic polymorphisms have been linked to the disease by genome-wide association studies.

Two that have received considerable recent interest are polymorphisms in the genes encoding receptors for the cytokines IL-2 and IL-7, which are known to control the activation and regulation of T cell–mediated immune responses. In view of the prominence of chronic inflammatory cells 
within and around MS plaques as well as the genetic evidence, immune-mediated myelin destruction is thought to have a central role in MS.

Evidence from human studies as well as from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis—an animal model of MS in which demyelination and inflammation occur after immunization with myelin, myelin proteins, or certain peptides from myelin proteins—has suggested that a range of immune cells contribute to lesion development in MS. A central role for CD4 + T cells has been suggested, with an 
increase in T
H17 and T H1 CD4+ cells thought to be a critical 
component of the injury to myelin.

There is also evidence for important contributions from CD8 + T cells and B cells. While 
MS is characterized by the presence of demyelination out of proportion to axonal loss, some injury to axons does occur. Toxic effects of lymphocytes, macrophages, and their secreted molecules have been implicated in initiating the process of axonal injury, sometimes even leading to neuronal death.

Leukodystrophies
Leukodystrophies exemplify inherited dysmyelinating dis-
eases in which the clinical symptoms derive from abnormal myelin synthesis or turnover. Some of these disorders involve lysosomal enzymes, while others involve peroxi -
somal enzymes; a few are associated with mutations in myelin proteins.

Most are of autosomal recessive inheri -
tance, although X-linked diseases also occur (Table 22–1).have demonstrated that there are often more lesions in the brains of patients with MS than might be expected from the clinical examination, and that lesions can come and go much more often than was previously suspected. Changes in cognitive function can be present, but are often much milder than the other deficits.

In any individual patient, 
it is hard to predict when the next relapse will occur; 
most current treatments, which are intended to control the immune response, aim at decreasing the rate and severity of relapses rather than recovering lost function. The CSF in patients with MS shows a mildly elevated 
protein level with an increased proportion of immuno -
globulin; in one third of cases, there is moderate pleocyto -
sis.

When the immunoglobulin is examined further, oligoclonal bands usually are identified. These antibodies are directed against a variety of antigenic targets and can be used as markers of disease activity. Although B cells are clearly involved in the pathogenesis of MS, the contribu -
tion of these characteristic antibodies to the disease process is unknown.

Other Acquired Demyelinating Diseases
Immune-mediated demyelination can occur after a number of systemic infectious illnesses, including relatively mild viral diseases. These are not thought to be related to direct spread of the infectious agents to the nervous system. Rather, it is believed that immune cells responding to pathogen-associated antigens are cross reactive against myelin antigens, resulting in myelin damage.

There are two general patterns of postinfectious autoim -
mune reactions to myelin; unlike in MS, they are associated with acute-onset monophasic illnesses. In acute disseminated 
encephalomyelitis, symptoms typically develop a week or two after an antecedent infection and are nonlocalizing (headache, lethargy, and coma), in contrast with the focal findings of MS. Symptoms progress rapidly, and the illness is fatal in as many as 20% of cases; in the remaining patients, there is complete recovery.

Acute necrotizing hemorrhagic 
encephalomyelitis is a more devastating related disorder, which typically affects young adults and children. Neuromyelitis optica
 (NMO) is an inflammatory demy -
elinating disease centered on the optic nerves and spinal cord. Previously thought to be a form of MS with stereo-typic anatomic regions of susceptibility, this is now recog -
nized to be an antibody-mediated autoimmune disorder.

nostic and pathogenic. Central pontine myelinolysis is a nonimmune process 
characterized by loss of myelin involving the center of the pons, most often after rapid correction of hyponatremia. The mechanism of oligodendroglial cell injury is uncertain, but it may be related to edema induced by sudden changes in osmotic pressure. It occurs in a variety of clinical settings including alcoholism and severe electrolyte or osmolar imbalance.

Although the most characteristic lesion occurs in the pons, similar lesions can be found elsewhere in the brain. Because of the involvement of fibers in the pons car -
rying signals to motor neurons in the spinal cord, patients often present with rapidly evolving quadriplegia. As discussed earlier, progressive multifocal leukoencepha -
lopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease that occurs after reactivation of JC virus in immunosuppressed patients.

MORPHOLOGY
Much of the pathologic change of leukodystrophy is found in the white matter, which is diffusely abnormal in color (gray and translucent) and volume (decreased). Early in their course, some diseases may show patchy involvement, while others have a predilection for occipital lobe involvement. In the end, though, nearly all of the white matter usually is affected.

With the loss of white matter, the brain becomes atrophic, the ventricles enlarge, and secondary changes can be found in the gray matter. Myelin loss leads to infiltration of macrophages, which often become stuffed with lipid. Some of these diseases also show specific inclusions created by the accumulation of particular lipids.

Clinical Features
Each of the various leukodystrophies has a characteristic 
clinical presentation, and most can be diagnosed by genetic or biochemical methods. Despite differences in underlying mechanisms, the leukodystrophies share many features because of the common myelin target. Affected children are normal at birth but begin to miss developmental mile -
stones during infancy and childhood.

Diffuse involvement of white matter leads to deterioration in motor skills, spas -
ticity, hypotonia, or ataxia. In general, the earlier the age at onset, the more severe the deficiency and clinical course.

835 Acquired Metabolic and Toxic Disturbances 
Vitamin B 12 Deficiency. In addition to pernicious anemia, 
deficiency of vitamin B 12 may lead to neurologic deficits 
associated with changes in the spinal cord, collectively 
termed subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord . As 
the name implies, both ascending and descending tracts of the spinal cord are affected. Symptoms develop over weeks.

Early clinical signs often include slight ataxia and 
lower extremity numbness and tingling, which can pro -
gress to spastic weakness of the lower extremities; some -
times even complete paraplegia ensues. Prompt vitamin replacement therapy produces clinical improvement; however, if paraplegia has developed, recovery is poor. Metabolic Disorders
Several systemic derangements may produce CNS dys -
function; only those associated with glucose levels and liver dysfunction are considered here.

Hypoglycemia. Since the brain requires glucose as a sub -
strate for energy production, the cellular effects of dimin -
ished glucose generally resemble those of global hypoxia. Hippocampal neurons are particularly susceptible to hypo -
glycemic injury, while cerebellar Purkinje cells are rela -
tively spared. As with anoxia, if the level and duration of hypoglycemia are sufficiently severe, there may be wide -
spread injury to many areas of the brain. Hyperglycemia.

Hyperglycemia is most common in the 
setting of inadequately controlled diabetes mellitus and can be associated with either ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma. Patients develop confusion, stupor, and eventually coma associated with intracellular dehydration caused by the hyperosmolar state. The hyperglycemia must be cor -
rected gradually, because rapid correction can produce severe cerebral edema. Hepatic Encephalopathy.

Decreased hepatic function may 
be associated with depressed levels of consciousness and sometimes coma. In the early stages, patients exhibit a characteristic “flapping” tremor (asterixis) when extending the arms with palms facing the observer. Elevated levels of ammonia, which the liver normally clears through the urea cycle, in combination with inflammation and hyponatre-mia, cause the changes in brain function.

Because it is only one contributing factor, ammonia levels in symptomatic patients vary widely. Within the CNS, ammonia metabo -
lism occurs only in astrocytes through the action of gluta -
mine synthetase, and in the setting of hyperammonemia, astrocytes in the cortex and basal ganglia develop swollen, pale nuclei (called Alzheimer type II cells). T oxic Disorders
The list of toxins with effects on the brain is extremely long.

Among the major categories of neurotoxic substances are ACQUIRED METABOLIC AND 
TOXIC DISTURBANCES
Toxic and acquired metabolic diseases are relatively common causes of neurologic illnesses. Because of its high metabolic demands, the brain is particularly vulnerable to nutritional diseases and alterations in metabolic state.

Sur -
prisingly, even though metabolic alterations might be expected to affect the entire brain uniformly, there can be very distinct clinical presentations because of unique fea -
tures or requirements of different anatomic regions. A few of the more common types of injury, particularly those with distinct patterns of damage, are discussed here. Nutritional Diseases
Thiamine Deficiency.

In addition to the systemic effects of 
thiamine deficiency (beriberi), there also may be abrupt onset of confusion, abnormalities in eye movement, and ataxia—a syndrome termed Wernicke encephalopathy. Treat-
ment with thiamine can reverse these deficits. If the acute stages go untreated, they are followed by largely irrevers -
ible profound memory disturbances (Korsakoff syndrome). Because the two syndromes are closely linked, the term Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is often applied.

The syndrome is particularly common in the setting of 
chronic alcoholism but also may be encountered in patients with thiamine deficiency resulting from gastric disorders, including carcinoma and chronic gastritis, or from persis -
tent vomiting. MORPHOLOGY
Wernicke encephalopathy is characterized by foci of hemor -
rhage and necrosis, particularly in the mammillary bodies but also adjacent to the ventricles, especially the third and fourth ventricles.

Despite the presence of necrosis, there is relative preservation of many of the neurons in these structures. SUMMARY
Primary Diseases of Myelin
- Because of the critical role of myelin in nerve conduction, 
diseases of myelin can lead to widespread and severe neurologic deficits.

- Diseases of myelin can be grouped into demyelinating dis-
eases (in which normal myelin is broken down for inap -
propriate reasons—often by inflammatory processes), and dysmyelinating diseases (metabolic disorders that include the leukodystrophies in which myelin structure or its turnover is abnormal). - Multiple scler osis, an autoimmune demyelinating disease, 
is the most common disorder of myelin, affecting young adults.

It often pursues a relapsing-remitting course, with eventual progressive accumulation of neurologic deficits. - Other, less common forms of immune-mediated demyelin -
ation often follow infections and are more acute illnesses. Early lesions show dilated capillaries with prominent endo -
thelial cells and progress to hemorrhage. As the lesions resolve, a cystic space appears along with hemosiderin-laden macrophages.

Lesions in the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus seem to best correlate with the memory distur -
bance in Korsakoff syndrome.

of neuronal dysfunction: those that affect the cerebral corti -
cal neurons result in loss of memory, language, insight, and 
planning, all components of dementia; those that affect the neurons of the basal ganglia result in movement disorders; those that affect the cerebellum result in ataxia; and those that affect motor neurons result in weakness.

Although many degenerative diseases have primary targets, other brain regions are often affected later in the course of the illness; thus, while Huntington disease often has move-ment disorders as an early symptom, later cortical involve -
ment typically results in the development of cognitive changes as well.

Dementia is defined as the development of 
memory impairment and other cognitive deficits severe enough to decrease the affected person’s capacity to func -
tion at the previous level despite a normal level of 
consciousness. It arises during the course of many neuro -
degenerative diseases; it also can accompany numerous other diseases that injure the cerebral cortex (Table 22–3). Dementia is an increasing public health concern as the population ages.

Alzheimer Disease
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population. The disease usually manifests with the insidious onset of impaired higher intel -
lectual function and altered mood and behavior. Later, this progresses to disorientation, memory loss, and aphasia, findings indicative of severe cortical dysfunction, and over another 5 to 10 years, the patient becomes profoundly dis-abled, mute, and immobile.

Death usually occurs from intercurrent pneumonia or other infections. Age is an metals, including lead (often causing a diffuse encephalopa -
thy), as well as arsenic and mercury; industrial chemicals, 
including organophosphates (in pesticides) and methanol (causing blindness from retinal damage); and environmental 
pollutants such as carbon monoxide (combining hypoxia with selective injury to the globus pallidus). Ethanol has a variety of effects on the brain.

While acute 
intoxication is reversible, excessive intake can result in pro -
found metabolic disturbances, including brain swelling and death. Chronic alcohol exposure leads to cerebellar dysfunction in about 1% cases, with truncal ataxia, unsteady gait, and nystagmus, associated with atrophy in the ante -
rior vermis of the cerebellum.

Ionizing radiation, commonly used to treat intracranial 
tumors, can cause rapidly evolving signs and symptoms including headaches, nausea, vomiting, and papilledema, even months to years after irradiation. Affected brain regions show large areas of coagulative necrosis, adjacent edema, and blood vessels with thickened walls containing intramural fibrin-like material.

NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES
Degenerative diseases of the CNS are disorders character-ized by the cellular degeneration of subsets of neurons that typically are related by function, rather than by physical location in the brain. Many of these disorders are associ-ated with the accumulation of abnormal proteins, which serve as histologic hallmarks of specific disorders ( Table 
22–2).

An important but unanswered question is why these abnormal proteins tend to accumulate in and preferentially affect particular kinds of neurons, since the involved pro -
teins typically are widely expressed throughout the nervous system. Subtle differences among subtypes of neurons are pre-
sumed to explain why particular neurons are affected in specific disorders.

Understandably, the clinical manifesta -

important risk factor for AD; the incidence is about 3% in 
persons 65 to 74 years old, 19% in those 75 to 84 years old, 
and 47% in those older than 84 years. Most cases of AD are sporadic, but at least 5% to 10% are familial. Sporadic cases rarely present before 50 years of age, but early onset is seen with some heritable forms.

PATHOGENESIS
Study of the familial forms of AD supports a model in which a peptide called beta amyloid, or A β, accumulates in the brain 
over time, initiating a chain of events that result in AD. A β is 
created when the transmembrane protein amyloid precursor protein (APP) is sequentially cleaved by the enzymes β-amyloid converting enzyme (BACE) and γ-secretase (Fig. 22–24). APP also can be cleaved by α-secretase and 
γ-secretase, which liberates a different peptide that is non -
pathogenic.

Mutations in APP or in components of γ-secretase 
(presenilin-1 or presenilin-2) lead to familial AD by increasing the rate at which Aβ is generated. The APP gene is located 
on chromosome 21, and the risk of AD also is higher in those with an extra copy of the APP gene, such as patients with 
trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) and persons with small inter -
stitial duplications of APP, presumably because this too leads 
to greater Aβ generation.

The other major genetic risk factor is a variant of apolipoprotein E called ε4 (Apo E4). Each 
Apo E4 allele that is present increases the risk of AD by approximately 4 fold and also appears to lower the age of onset. How Apo E4 influences A β accumulation is unknown; 
it may increase A β aggregation or deposition, or decrease 
Aβ clearance.

While large deposits of Aβ are a feature of end-stage AD, 
small aggregates of A β may also be pathogenic, as they alter 
neurotransmission and are toxic to neurons and synaptic endings. Large deposits, in the form of plaques, also lead to neuronal death, elicit a local inflammatory response that can result in further cell injury, and may cause altered region-to-region communication through mechanical effects on axons and dendrites.

The presence of A β also leads to hyperphosphorylation of 
the neuronal microtubule binding protein tau. This increased 
Figure 22–24 Aβ peptide genesis and consequences in Alzheimer disease.

Amyloid precursor protein cleavage by α-secretase and γ-secretase pro-
duces a harmless soluble peptide, whereas amyloid precursor protein cleavage by β-amyloid–converting enzyme (BACE) and γ-secretase releases Aβ 
peptides, which form pathogenic aggregates and contribute to the characteristic plaques and tangles of Alzheimer disease.

MORPHOLOGY
Macroscopic examination of the brain shows a variable 
degree of cortical atrophy, resulting in a widening of the cerebral sulci that is most pronounced in the frontal, tempo -
ral, and parietal lobes. With significant atrophy, there is com -
pensatory ventricular enlargement (hydrocephalus ex vacuo).

At the microscopic level, AD is diagnosed by the presence of plaques (an extracellular lesion); and neurofibrillary 
tangles (an intracellular lesion) (Fig. 22–25). Because these may also be present to a lesser extent in the brains of elderly nondemented persons, the current criteria for a diagnosis of AD are based on a combination of clinical and pathologic features.

There is a fairly constant progressive involvement of different parts of the brain: pathologic changes (specifically plaques, tangles, and the associated neuronal loss and glial reaction) are evident first in the entorhinal cortex, then in the hippocampal formation and isocortex, and finally in the neo -
cortex. Silver staining or immunohistochemistry methods are extremely helpful in assessing the true lesional burden.

Neuritic plaques are focal, spherical collections of 
dilated, tortuous, silver-staining neuritic processes (dystro -
phic neurites), often around a central amyloid core ( Fig. 22–25, A
). Neuritic plaques range in size from 20 to 200 µm 
in diameter; microglial cells and reactive astrocytes are present at their periphery.

Plaques can be found in the 
hippocampus and amygdala as well as in the neocortex, although there usually is relative sparing of primary motor and sensory cortices until late in the disease course. The amyloid core contains A β (Fig. 22–25, B).

Aβ deposits also 
can be found that lack the surrounding neuritic reaction, termed diffuse plaques; these typically are found in the 
superficial cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebel -
lar cortex and may represent an early stage of plaque development. Neurofibrillary tangles are bundles of paired helical 
filaments visible as basophilic fibrillary structures in the

They are commonly found in cortical neurons, especially in the entorhinal cortex, as well as in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, the amygdala, the basal forebrain, and the raphe nuclei. A major component of paired helical filaments is abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau (Fig. 22–25, C).

Tangles are not specific to AD, being 
found in other degenerative diseases as well.level of phosphorylation causes tau to redistribute from axons into dendrites and cell bodies, where it aggregates into tangles, which also contribute to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration
Another major category of disease that results in dementia is called frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).

These dis -
orders share clinical features (progressive deterioration of language and changes in personality) stemming from the degeneration and atrophy of temporal and frontal lobes; the clinical syndromes commonly are referred to as fronto-
temporal dementias. When the frontal lobe bears the greatest burden of disease, behavioral changes often dominate, whereas when the disease begins in the temporal lobe, language problems often are the presenting complaint.

These symptoms precede memory disturbances, which can assist in their separation from AD on clinical grounds. On gross inspection, there is atrophy of the brain that 
predominantly affects the frontal and temporal lobes. Dif-ferent subgroups are characterized by neuronal inclusions involving the affected regions. In some cases the defining inclusions contain tau (FTLD-tau), but the configuration of the tau inclusions differs from the tau-containing tangles of AD.

FTLD-tau sometimes is caused by mutations in the gene encoding tau. One well-recognized subtype of FTLD-tau is Pick disease, which is associated with smooth, round 
inclusions known as Pick bodies. The other major form of 
FTLD is characterized by aggregates containing the DNA/RNA-binding protein TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP43). This form of FTLD is associated with predominantly frontal lobe cogni -
tive impairment.

It is sometimes caused by mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43, which is also mutated in a subset of cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (described later).

839 Neurodegenerative Diseases
Parkinson Disease
Parkinsonism is a clinical syndrome characterized by tremor, 
rigidity, bradykinesia and instability. These types of motor disturbances may be seen in a range of diseases that damage dopaminergic neurons, which project from the substantia nigra to the striatum. Parkinsonism can be induced by drugs such as dopamine antagonists or toxins that selec -
tively injure dopaminergic neurons.

Among the neurode -
generative diseases, most cases of parkinsonism are caused by Parkinson disease (PD), which is associated with charac-
teristic neuronal inclusions containing α-synuclein.

Other 
diseases in which parkinsonism may be present include multiple system atrophy (MSA), in which α-synuclein aggre-
gates are found in oligodendrocytes; progressive supranu-
clear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), which 
are both associated with tau-containing inclusions in neurons and glial cells; and postencephalitic parkinsonism, 
which was associated with the 1918 influenza pandemic. MORPHOLOGY
A typical gross finding at autopsy is pallor of the substantia nigra (Fig.

22–26, A and B) and locus ceruleus. Microscopic 
features include loss of the pigmented, catecholaminergic neurons in these regions associated with gliosis. Lewy 
bodies (Fig. 22–26, C) may be found in those neurons that 
remain. These are single or multiple, intracytoplasmic, eosin -
ophilic, round to elongated inclusions that often have a dense core surrounded by a pale halo.

On ultrastructural examina -
tion, Lewy bodies consist of fine filaments, densely packed in the core but loose at the rim, composed of α-synuclein and 
other proteins, including neurofilaments and ubiquitin. The other major histologic finding is Lewy neurites, dystrophic 
neurites that also contain abnormally aggregated α-synuclein.

As implied by the occurrence of a broad array of neuro -
logic deficits in PD, immunohistochemical staining for α-
synuclein highlights more subtle Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in many brain regions outside of the substantia nigra and in nondopaminergic neurons. These lesions appear first in the medulla and then in the pons, before involvement of the substantia nigra.

As implied by the dementia, Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites eventually appear in the cerebral cortex and subcortical areas, including the cholinergic cells of the basal nucleus of Meynert and the amygdala. A B
 C
Figure 22–26 Parkinson disease. A, Normal substantia nigra. B, Depigmented substantia nigra in idiopathic Parkinson disease. C, Lewy body in a 
neuron from the substantia nigra stains pink.

PATHOGENESIS
While PD in most cases is sporadic, both autosomal domi -
nant and recessive forms of the disease also exist. Point mutations and duplications of the gene encoding α-synuclein, 
a protein involved in synaptic transmission, cause autosomal dominant PD. Even in sporadic PD, the diagnostic feature of the disease—the Lewy body—is an inclusion containing α-synuclein. The linkage between α-synuclein and disease 
pathogenesis is unclear, but other genetic forms of PD provide some clues.

Two other causative genetic loci encode the proteins parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and UCHL-1, an enzyme involved in recycling of ubiquitin from proteins tar -
geted to the proteasome, suggesting that defects in protein degradation may have a pathogenic role.

Another tantalizing clue comes from the association of PD with mutations in a protein kinase called LRRK2; histopathologic examination of cases associated with LRRK2 mutations may show either Lewy bodies containing α-synuclein or tangles containing tau. Finally, some forms of familial PD are associated with muta-tions in the PARK7 or PINK1 genes, both of which appear to 
be important for normal mitochondrial function.

Clinical Features
PD commonly manifests as a movement disorder in the absence of a toxic exposure or other known underlying etiology. The disease usually progresses over 10 to 15 years, eventually producing severe motor slowing to the point of near immobility. Death usually is the result of intercurrent infection or trauma from frequent falls caused by postural instability.

Movement symptoms of PD initially respond to 
L-
dihydroxyphenylalanine ( L-DOPA), but this treatment 
does not slow disease progression. Over time, L-DOPA 
becomes less effective and begins to cause potentially prob -
lematic fluctuations in motor function. While the movement disorder associated with loss of the 
nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway is an important feature of PD, it is clear that the disease has more extensive clinical and pathologic manifestations. Lesions can be found lower

Spinocerebellar Ataxias
Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinically heteroge -
neous group of diseases that are frequently caused by 
trinucleotide repeat expansion mutations. They are distin -
guished from one another by differences in causative muta -
tions, patterns of inheritance, age at onset, and signs and 
symptoms.

This group of diseases affects, to a variable extent, the cerebellar cortex, spinal cord, other brain regions, and peripheral nerves. As a result, clinical findings may include a combination of cerebellar and sensory ataxia, spasticity, and sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. Degeneration of neurons, often without distinctive histo -
pathologic changes, occurs in the affected areas and is asso -
ciated with mild gliosis.

The additional clinical symptoms that accompany the ataxia can help distinguish between well-characterized subtypes. Although more than two dozen distinct genetic types of SCA have been identified, there remain many cases which do not fall into one of the already characterized forms.

in the brain stem (in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and in the reticular formation) in advance of nigral involve -
ment, in line with clinical studies showing that autonomic dysfunction and behavioral disorders often are present in advance of the motor problems. Dementia, typically with a mildly fluctuating course and hallucinations, emerges in many persons with PD and is attributable to involvement of the cerebral cortex.

When dementia arises within 1 year of the onset of motor symptoms, it is referred to Lewy body 
dementia (LBD). Huntington Disease
Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant move -
ment disorder associated with degeneration of the striatum (caudate and putamen). The movement disorder is chorei -
form (dancelike), with increased and involuntary jerky movements of all parts of the body; writhing movements of the extremities are typical.

The disease is relentlessly pro -
gressive, resulting in death after an average course of about 15 years. Early cognitive symptoms include forgetfulness and thought and affective disorders, and there may be progres -
sion to a severe dementia. As a part of these early behav -
ioral changes, HD carries an increased risk of suicide. MORPHOLOGY
On gross examination, the brain is small and shows striking atrophy of the caudate nucleus and, sometimes less dramati-cally, the putamen ( Fig. 22–27).

Pathologic changes develop 
over the course of the illness in a medial to lateral direction in the caudate and from dorsal to ventral in the putamen. The 
Figure 22–27 Huntington disease. Normal hemisphere on the left com-
pared with the hemisphere with Huntington disease on the right showing

globus pallidus may be atrophied secondarily, and the lateral and third ventricles are dilated. Atrophy frequently is also seen in the frontal lobe, less often in the parietal lobe, and occasionally in the entire cortex. Microscopic examination reveals severe loss of neurons 
from affected regions of the striatum.

The medium-sized, spiny neurons that release the neurotransmitters γ-
aminobutyric acid (GABA), enkephalin, dynorphin, and sub -
stance P are especially sensitive, disappearing early in the disease. Also seen is fibrillary gliosis, which is more extensive than in the usual reaction to neuronal loss. There is a strong correlation between the degree of degeneration in the stria -
tum and the severity of motor symptoms; there is also an association between cortical neuronal loss and dementia.

In remaining striatal neurons and in the cortex, there are intra -
nuclear inclusions that contain aggregates of ubiquitinated huntingtin protein (Fig. 22–27, inset). PATHOGENESIS
HD is caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions 
in a gene located on 4p16.3 that encodes the protein hun -
tingtin. Normal alleles contain 11 to 34 copies of the repeat; in disease-causing alleles the number of repeats is increased, sometimes into the hundreds.

There is strong genotype-phenotype correlation, with larger numbers of repeats result -
ing in earlier-onset disease. Once the symptoms appear, however, the course of the illness is not affected by repeat length. Further expansions of the pathologic CAG repeats can occur during spermatogenesis, so paternal transmission may be associated with earlier onset in the next generation, a phenomenon referred to as anticipation (Chapter 6).

HD appears to be caused by a toxic gain-of-function muta -
tion somehow related to the expanded polyglutamine tract in huntingtin. The mutant protein is subject to ubiquitination and proteolysis, yielding fragments that can form large intra -
nuclear aggregates. As in other degenerative diseases, smaller aggregates of the abnormal protein fragments are suspected to be the critical toxic agent.

These aggregates may sequester transcription factors, disrupt protein degradation pathways, perturb mitochondrial function, or alter brain-derived neuro -
trophic factor (BDNF) signaling. It is likely that some 
combination of these aberrations contributes to HD pathogenesis.

841 Neurodegenerative Diseases
MORPHOLOGY
The most striking gross changes are found in anterior roots 
of the spinal cord, which are thin and gray (rather than white). In especially severe cases, the precentral gyrus (motor cortex) may be mildly atrophic. Microscopic examination demonstrates a reduction in the number of anterior horn cell neurons throughout the length of the spinal cord associated with reactive gliosis and loss of anterior root myelinated fibers.

Similar findings are found with involvement of motor cranial nerve nuclei except those supplying the extraocular muscles, which are spared except in very longstanding survi -
vors. Remaining lower motor neurons often harbor cytoplas-mic inclusions that contain TDP-43, except in those cases in which the underlying cause is a mutation in SOD-1. Death of upper motor neurons—a finding that may be 
hard to demonstrate microscopically—results in degenera-tion of the descending corticospinal tracts.

This is usually easily seen in the spinal cord. With the loss of innervation from the death of anterior horn cells, skeletal muscles show neurogenic atrophy. As with Huntington disease, several forms of SCA (SCA 
types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17 and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) are caused by CAG repeat expansions encoding polyglutamine tracts in various genes.

In these forms of SCA, neuronal intranuclear inclusions are present contain -
ing the abnormal protein and there is an inverse correlation between the degree of repeat expansion and age of onset. Other SCAs are caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions in untranslated regions or by other types of mutations. Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder that 
generally manifests in the first decade of life with gait ataxia, followed by hand clumsiness and dysarthria.

Most patients develop pes cavus and kyphoscoliosis, and there is a high incidence of cardiac disease and diabetes. The disease usually is caused by a GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in the gene encoding frataxin, a protein that regulates cellular iron levels, particularly in the mitochon -
dria. The repeat expansion results in decreased protein levels through transcriptional silencing; rare cases in which point mutations produce a nonfunctional frataxin protein also have been described.

Decreased frataxin leads to mito -
chondrial dysfunction as well as increased oxidative damage. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) results from the death of lower motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem, and of upper motor neurons (Betz cells) in the motor cortex.

The loss of lower motor neurons results in denervation of muscles, muscular atrophy (the “amyotrophy” of the con -
dition), weakness, and fasciculations, while the loss of upper motor neurons results in paresis, hyperreflexia, and spasticity, along with a Babinski sign. An additional con -
sequence of upper motor neuron loss is degeneration of the corticospinal tracts in the lateral portion of the spinal cord (“lateral sclerosis”).

Sensation usually is unaffected, but cognitive impairment does occur, sometimes as a fronto-temporal dementia. The disease affects men slightly more frequently than 
women and becomes clinically manifest in the fifth decade or later, usually beginning with subtle asymmetric distal extremity weakness. As the disease progresses to involve more of the motor system, muscle strength and bulk dimin -
ish and involuntary contractions of individual motor 
units, termed fasciculations, occur.

The disease eventually involves the respiratory muscles, leading to recurrent bouts of pulmonary infection, which is the usual cause of death. The balance between upper and lower motor neuron involvement can vary, although most patients exhibit involvement of both. In some patients, degeneration of the lower brain stem cranial motor nuclei occurs early and progresses rapidly, a pattern of disease referred to as bulbar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

With this disease pattern, abnormalities of swallowing and speaking dominate. SUMMARY
Neurodegenerative Diseases
- Neurodegenerative diseases cause symptoms that depend 
on the pattern of brain involvement. Cortical disease usually manifests as cognitive change, alterations in per -
sonality, and memory disturbances; basal ganglia disorders usually manifest as movement disorders.

- Many neurodegenerative diseases preferentially affect a 
primary set of brain regions, but other regions can be involved later in the disease course. This evolving process can change the phenotype of the disease over time—as with the appearance of cognitive impairments in people initially affected by the movement disorder of Parkinson disease.

- Many of the neurodegenerative diseases are associated 
with various protein aggregates, which serve as pathologic 
PATHOGENESIS
While most cases are sporadic, 5% to 10% are familial, mostly with autosomal dominant inheritance. Familial disease begins 
earlier in life than sporadic disease, but once symptoms appear, the clinical course is similar in both forms.

More than a dozen genes have been implicated, but the most frequent genetic cause (20% of cases) is mutations in the superoxide dismutase gene, SOD-1, on chromosome 21. These muta -
tions are thought to generate abnormal misfolded forms of the SOD-1 protein, which may trigger the unfolded protein response and cause apoptotic death of neurons. The next two most common causative genes both encode DNA/RNA binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS; how these mutations cause disease is unknown.

As already mentioned, mutations in TDP-43 also can cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) or a disease with overlapping features of both ALS and FTLD.

symptoms are seizures, headaches, and focal neurologic 
deficits related to the anatomic site of involvement. They show a spectrum of histologic differentiation that corre -
lates well with clinical course and outcome.

On the basis of histologic features, they are stratified into three groups: well-differentiated astrocytoma (grade II/IV), anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III/IV), and glioblastoma (grade IV/IV), with increasingly grim prognosis as the grade increases. Well-differentiated astrocytomas can be static for several 
years, but at some point they progress; the mean survival is more than 5 years.

Eventually, patients suffer rapid clini -
cal deterioration that is correlated with the appearance of anaplastic features and more rapid tumor growth. Other patients present with glioblastoma from the start. Once the histologic features of glioblastoma appear, the prognosis is very poor; with treatment (resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy), the median survival is only 15 months. Astrocytomas are associated with a variety of acquired 
mutations, which cluster in several important pathways.

In glioblastoma, loss-of-function mutations in the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor pathways and gain-of-function muta-tions in the oncogenic PI3K pathways have central roles in tumorigenesis. Surprisingly, mutations that alter the enzy -
matic activity of two isoforms of the metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 and IDH2) are common in lower-grade astrocytomas.

As a result, immunostaining for the mutated form of IDH1 has become an important diag -
nostic tool in evaluating biopsy specimens for the presence of low-grade astrocytoma. TUMORS
The annual incidence of CNS tumors ranges from 10 to 17 per 100,000 persons for intracranial tumors and 1 to 2 per 100,000 persons for intraspinal tumors; about half to three quarters are primary tumors, and the rest are metastatic.

Tumors of the CNS make up a larger proportion of child -
hood cancers, accounting for as many of 20% of all pediat-ric tumors. Childhood CNS tumors differ from those in adults in both histologic subtype and location. In child -
hood, tumors are likely to arise in the posterior fossa; in adults, they are mostly supratentorial. Tumors of the nervous system have unique characteris-
tics that set them apart from neoplastic processes elsewhere in the body.

- These tumors do not have detectable premalignant or in 
situ stages comparable to those of carcinomas. - Even low-grade lesions may infiltrate large regions of 
the brain, leading to serious clinical deficits, nonresect -
ability, and poor prognosis.

- The anatomic site of the neoplasm can influence outcome 
independent of histologic classification due to local 
effects (e.g., a benign meningioma may cause cardiores -
piratory arrest from compression of the medulla) or non -
resectability (e.g., brain stem gliomas). - Even the most highly malignant gliomas rarely spread 
outside of the CNS; in addition to local infiltration, the subarachnoid space allows for spread to distant sites along the neuroaxis.

Gliomas
Gliomas are tumors of the brain parenchyma that are clas -
sified histologically on the basis of their resemblance to different types of glial cells. The major types of glial tumors are astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas. The most common types are highly infiltrative or 
“diffuse gliomas,” including astrocytic, oligodendroglial, and mixed forms. In contrast, ependymomas tend to form solid masses.

Astrocytoma
Several different categories of astrocytic tumors are recog-nized, the most common being diffuse and pilocytic astro -
cytomas. Different types of astrocytomas have characteristic histologic features, anatomic distributions, and clinical features. Diffuse Astrocytoma
Diffuse astrocytomas account for about 80% of adult gliomas. They are most frequent in the fourth through the sixth decades of life. They usually are found in the cerebral hemispheres.

The most common presenting signs and MORPHOLOGY
Well-differentiated astrocytomas are poorly defined, gray, infiltrative tumors that expand and distort the invaded brain without forming a discrete mass ( Fig. 22–28, A). Infiltration 
beyond the grossly evident margins is always present. The cut surface of the tumor is either firm or soft and gelatinous; cystic degeneration may be seen. In glioblastoma, variation in the gross appearance of the tumor from region to region is characteristic (Fig.

22–28, B). Some areas are firm and white, 
others are soft and yellow (the result of tissue necrosis), 
and still others show regions of cystic degeneration and hemorrhage. Well-differentiated astrocytomas are characterized by a 
mild to moderate increase in the number of glial cell nuclei, somewhat variable nuclear pleomorphism, and an intervening feltwork of fine, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytic cell processes that give the background a fibrillary appearance.

The transition between neoplastic and normal tissue is indistinct, and tumor cells can be seen infiltrating normal tissue many centimeters from the main lesion. Ana -
plastic astrocytomas show regions that are more densely cellular and have greater nuclear pleomorphism; mitotic figures are present. Glioblastoma has a histologic appearance similar to that of anaplastic astrocytoma, as well as either necrosis (often with pseudopalisading nuclei) or vascular pro -
liferation (Fig. 22–28, C). hallmarks.

It is unclear whether these striking inclusions and deposits are critical mediators of cellular degenera -
tion. Familial forms of these diseases are associated with mutations in the genes encoding these proteins or con -
trolling their metabolism. Pilocytic Astrocytoma
Pilocytic astrocytomas are relatively benign tumors, typi-cally affecting children and young adults. Most commonly

MORPHOLOGY
Well-differentiated oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade II/IV) 
are infiltrative tumors that form gelatinous, gray masses 
and may show cysts, focal hemorrhage, and calcification.

On microscopic examination, the tumor is composed of sheets of regular cells with spherical nuclei containing finely granular-appearing chromatin (similar to that in normal 
MORPHOLOGY
A pilocytic astrocytoma often is cystic, with a mural nodule in the wall of the cyst; if solid, it is usually well circumscribed. The tumor is composed of bipolar cells with long, thin “hair -
like” processes that are GFAP-positive.

Rosenthal fibers, eosinophilic granular bodies, and microcysts are often present; necrosis and mitoses are rare. located in the cerebellum, they also may involve the third 
ventricle, the optic pathways, spinal cord, and occasionally the cerebral hemispheres. There is often a cyst associated with the tumor, and symptomatic recurrence from incom -
pletely resected lesions is often associated with cyst enlarge -
ment, rather than growth of the solid component.

Tumors that involve the hypothalamus are especially problematic because they cannot be resected completely. A high proportion of pilocytic astrocytomas have acti -
vating mutations in the serine-threonine kinase BRAF—either a specific point mutation (V600E) that is also found in many other cancers (Chapter 5), or more commonly a partial tandem duplication event. Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 (common in low-grade diffuse astrocytomas) are not found in pilocytic tumors.

These genetic distinctions support the division of these astrocytomas into two diag -
nostic categories. Oligodendroglioma
Oligodendrogliomas account for 5% to 15% of gliomas and most commonly are detected in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Patients may have had several years of antecedent neurologic complaints, often including seizures. The lesions are found mostly in the cerebral hemispheres, mainly in the frontal or temporal lobes.

Patients with oligodendrogliomas enjoy a better prog-
nosis than that for patients with astrocytomas of similar grade. Treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radio-therapy yields an average survival of 10 to 20 years for well-differentiated (WHO grade II) or 5 to 10 years for anaplastic (WHO grade III) oligodendrogliomas. The most common genetic findings are deletions of chromosomes 1p and 19q, alterations that typically occur together.

Tumors with deletions of 1p and 19q are usually highly responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A

MORPHOLOGY
In the fourth ventricle, ependymomas typically are solid or 
papillary masses extending from the ventricular floor. The tumors are composed of cells with regular, round to oval nuclei and abundant granular chromatin. Between the nuclei is a variably dense fibrillary background.

Tumor cells may form round or elongated structures (rosettes, canals) that 
resemble the embryologic ependymal canal, with long, deli-cate processes extending into a lumen (Fig. 23–29, B); more 
frequently present are perivascular pseudorosettes in 
which tumor cells are arranged around vessels with an inter -
vening zone containing thin ependymal processes. Anaplastic ependymomas show increased cell density, high mitotic rates, necrosis, and less evident ependymal differentiation.

oligodendrocytes) surrounded by a clear halo of cytoplasm (Fig. 22–29, A). The tumor typically contains a delicate 
network of anastomosing capillaries. Calcification, present in as many as 90% of these tumors, ranges in extent from microscopic foci to massive depositions. Mitotic activity usually is difficult to detect. Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO grade III/IV) is a more aggressive subtype with higher cell density, nuclear anaplasia and mitotic activity. A

Ependymomas most often arise next to the ependyma-lined ventricular system, including the central canal of the spinal cord. In the first 2 decades of life, they typically occur near the fourth ventricle and constitute 5% to 10% of the primary brain tumors in this age group.

In adults, the spinal cord is their most common location; tumors in this site are particularly frequent in the setting of neurofibro -
matosis type 2 (Chapter 21). The clinical outcome for com -
pletely resected supratentorial and spinal ependymomas is better than for those in the posterior fossa.commonly the lateral or third ventricles), characterized by evenly spaced, round, uniform nuclei and often islands of neuropil.

Gangliogliomas are tumors with a mixture of glial 
elements, usually a low-grade astrocytoma, and mature-appearing neurons. Most of these tumors are slow-growing, but the glial component occasionally becomes frankly ana-plastic, and the disease then progresses rapidly. These lesions often manifest with seizures.

Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor is a distinctive, 
low-grade childhood tumor that grows slowly and carries a relatively good prognosis after resection; it often mani -
fests as a seizure disorder. It typically is located in the superficial temporal lobe and consists of small round neu -
ronal cells arranged in columns and around central cores of processes. These typically form multiple discrete intra -
cortical nodules that have a myxoid background.

Also present are well-differentiated “floating” neurons within pools of mucopolysaccharide-rich myxoid fluid. Embryonal (Primitive) Neoplasms
Some tumors of neuroectodermal origin have a primitive “small round cell” appearance that is reminiscent of normal progenitor cells encountered in the developing CNS. Dif -
ferentiation is often limited, but may progress along mul -
tiple lineages. The most common is the medulloblastoma, 
accounting for 20% of pediatric brain tumors.

Medulloblastoma
Medulloblastoma occurs predominantly in children and exclusively in the cerebellum. Neuronal and glial markers are nearly always expressed, at least to a limited extent. It is highly malignant, and the prognosis for untreated patients is dismal; however, medulloblastoma is exqui -
sitely radiosensitive. With total excision, chemotherapy, and irradiation, the 5-year survival rate may be as high as 75%.

Tumors of similar histologic type and a poor degree of differentiation can be found elsewhere in the nervous system, where they are called primitive neuroectodermal 
tumors (PNETs). Neuronal T umors
Central neurocytoma is a low-grade neoplasm found within and adjacent to the ventricular system (most

the tumors are nearly always positive for the oncogenic 
Epstein-Barr virus. In nonimmunosuppressed populations, 
the age spectrum is relatively wide, with the incidence increasing after 60 years of age. Regardless of the clinical context, primary brain lymphoma is an aggressive disease with relatively poor response to chemotherapy as com -
pared with peripheral lymphomas.

Patients with primary brain lymphoma often are found 
to have multiple tumor nodules within the brain paren -
chyma, yet involvement outside of the CNS is an uncom -
mon late complication. Lymphoma originating outside the CNS rarely spreads to the brain parenchyma; when it happens, tumor usually is also within the CSF or involve -
ment of the meninges.

Genetic analysis of medulloblastoma has revealed that 
morphologically similar tumors commonly exhibit distinct alterations, and that there is a relationship between the underlying mutations and outcome. In general, tumors with MYC amplifications are associated with poor out -
comes, while those linked with mutations in genes of the WNT signaling pathway have a more favorable course.

Many tumors also have mutations that activate the sonic hedgehog (shh) pathway, which has a critical role in tumorigenesis but an uncertain relationship to outcome. These genetic distinctions are beginning to be used to strat -
ify patients into different risk groups and guide therapy. Ideally, it would be best to avoid CNS radiotherapy in young patients, and it is hoped that new therapies target -
ing mutated gene products will achieve this goal.

Other Parenchymal T umors
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
Primary CNS lymphoma, occurring mostly as diffuse large B cell lymphomas, accounts for 2% of extranodal lympho -
mas and 1% of intracranial tumors. It is the most common CNS neoplasm in immunosuppressed persons, in whom MORPHOLOGY
In children, medulloblastomas are located in the midline of the cerebellum; lateral tumors occur more often in adults.

The tumor often is well circumscribed, gray, and friable 
and may be seen extending to the surface of the cerebellar folia and involving the leptomeninges ( Fig. 22–30, A). Medul-
loblastomas are extremely cellular, with sheets of anaplastic (“small blue”) cells ( Fig. 22–30, B). Individual tumor cells are 
small, with little cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei; mitoses are abundant.

Often, focal neuronal differentiation is seen in the form of the Homer Wright or neuroblastic rosette, which closely resembles the rosettes encountered in neuroblastomas; they are characterized by primitive tumor cells surrounding central neuropil (delicate pink material formed by neuronal processes).

MORPHOLOGY
Lesions often involve deep gray structures, as well as the white matter and the cortex. Periventricular spread is common. The tumors are relatively well defined as compared with glial neoplasms but are not as discrete as metastases. EBV-associated tumors often show extensive areas of necro-sis. The tumors are nearly always aggressive large B-cell lym -
phomas, although other histologic types can be observed rarely (Chapter 11).

Microscopically, malignant cells accumu -
late around blood vessels and infiltrate the surrounding brain parenchyma. Germ Cell Tumors
Primary brain germ cell tumors occur along the midline, 
most commonly in the pineal and the suprasellar regions. They account for 0.2% to 1% of brain tumors in people of European descent but as many as 10% of brain tumors in persons of Japanese ethnicity. They are a tumor of the young, with 90% occurring during the first 2 decades of life.

Germ cell tumors in the pineal region show a strong male predominance. The most common primary CNS germ cell tumor is germinoma, a tumor that closely resembles testicular seminoma (Chapter 17). Secondary CNS involve -
ment by metastatic gonadal germ cell tumors also occurs.

Metastatic T umors
Metastatic lesions, mostly carcinomas, account for approxi -
mately one fourth to one half of intracranial tumors. The 
most common primary sites are lung, breast, skin (mela-noma), kidney, and gastrointestinal tract—together these account for about 80% of cases. Metastases form sharply demarcated masses, often at the gray-white junction, and elicit edema (Fig. 22–32).

The boundary between tumor and brain parenchyma is sharp at the microscopic level as well, with surrounding reactive gliosis. In addition to the direct and localized effects produced 
by metastases, paraneoplastic syndromes may involve the 
peripheral and central nervous systems, sometimes even preceding the clinical recognition of the malignant neo -
plasm. Many but not all patients with paraneoplastic syn -
dromes have antibodies against tumor antigens.

Some of the more common patterns include
- Subacute cerebellar degeneration resulting in ataxia, with 
destruction of Purkinje cells, gliosis, and a mild inflam -
matory infiltrate
- Limbic encephalitis causing a subacute dementia, with perivascular inflammatory cells, microglial nodules, some neuronal loss, and gliosis, all centered in the medial temporal lobe MORPHOLOGY
Meningiomas (WHO grade I/IV) grow as well-defined dura-based masses that may compress the brain but do not invade it ( Fig.

22–31, A). Extension into the overlying bone 
may be present. Among the varied histologic patterns are syncytial, named for whorled clusters of cells without visible cell membranes that sit in tight groups; fibroblastic, with 
elongated cells and abundant collagen deposition between them; transitional, which shares features of the syncytial 
and fibroblastic types; psammomatous, with numerous 
Meningiomas
Meningiomas are predominantly benign tumors that arise from arachnoid meningothelial cells.

They usually occur in adults and are often attached to the dura. Meningiomas may be found along any of the external surfaces of the brain as well as within the ventricular system, where they arise from the stromal arachnoid cells of the choroid plexus. They usually come to attention because of vague nonlocal-izing symptoms, or with focal findings referable to com -
pression of adjacent brain.

Although most meningiomas are easily separable from underlying brain, some tumors infiltrate the brain, a feature that is associated with an increased risk of recurrence. The overall prognosis is deter-mined by the lesion size and location, surgical accessibility, and histologic grade. When a person has multiple meningiomas, especially 
in association with eighth-nerve schwannomas or glial tumors, the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) should be considered (Chapter 21).

About half of menin -
giomas not associated with NF2 have acquired loss-of-function mutations in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene on 
the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q). These mutations are found in all grades of meningioma, suggesting that they are involved with tumor initiation. Mutations in NF2 are 
more common in tumors with certain growth patterns (fibroblastic, transitional, and psammomatous). A

Atypical meningiomas (WHO grade II/IV) are recog -
nized by the presence of certain histologic features (promi -
nent nucleoli, increased cellularity, pattern-less growth), and often have a higher mitotic rate. These tumors demonstrate more aggressive local growth and a higher rate of recurrence; they may require therapy in addition to surgery.

Anaplastic (malignant) meningiomas (WHO grade 
III/IV) are highly aggressive tumors that may resemble a high-grade sarcoma or carcinoma, although there usually is some histologic evidence of a meningothelial cell origin.

SUMMARY
T umors of the Central Nervous System
- T umors of the CNS may arise from the cells of the cover -
ings (meningiomas), the brain (gliomas, neuronal tumors, choroid plexus tumors), or other CNS cell populations (primary CNS lymphoma, germ cell tumors), or they may originate elsewhere in the body (metastases).

MORPHOLOGY
The cerebellar capillary hemangioblastoma, the 
principal neurologic manifestation of the disease, is a highly vascular neoplasm that occurs as a mural nodule associated with a large, fluid-filled cyst. On microscopic examination, 
the lesion consists of numerous capillary-sized or some -
what larger thin-walled vessels separated by intervening stromal cells with vacuolated, lightly PAS-positive, lipid-rich cytoplasm.

MORPHOLOGY
Cortical hamartomas are firmer than normal cortex and have been likened in appearance to potatoes—hence the appella -
tion “tubers.” They are composed of haphazardly arranged large neurons that lack the normal cortical laminar architec -
ture. These cells may exhibit a mixture of glial and neuronal features, having large vesicular nuclei with nucleoli (like neurons) and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (like gemisto-cytic astrocytes).

Similar abnormal cells are present in the subependymal nodules, in which large astrocyte-like cells cluster beneath the ventricular surface.

- Subacute sensory neuropathy leading to altered pain sensa-
tion, with loss of sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia, in association with inflammation
- Syndrome of rapid-onset psychosis, catatonia, epilepsy, and coma associated with ovarian teratoma and antibodies against the N-methyl-
D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
Familial T umor Syndromes
Several inherited syndromes caused by mutations in various tumor suppressor genes are associated with an increased risk of particular types of cancers.

Those with particular involvement of the CNS are discussed here; familial syndromes associated with tumors of the periph -
eral nervous system are covered in Chapter 21. Tuberous Sclerosis
Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant syn -
drome characterized by the development of hamartomas and benign neoplasms involving the brain and other tissues.

CNS hamartomas variously consist of cortical tubers and subependymal hamartomas, including a larger tumefactive form known as subependymal giant cell astro -
cytoma. Because of their proximity to the foramen of Monro, they often present acutely with obstructive hydro -
cephalus, which requires surgical intervention and/or therapy with an m TOR inhibitor (see below). Seizures are associated with cortical tubers and can be difficult to control with antiepileptic drugs.

Extracerebral lesions include renal angiomyolipomas, retinal glial hamartomas, pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis, and cardiac rhabdo -
myomas. Cysts may be found at various sites, including the liver, kidneys, and pancreas. Cutaneous lesions include angiofibromas, leathery thickenings in localized patches (shagreen patches), hypopigmented areas (ash leaf patches), and subungual fibromas. TSC results from disruption of either TSC1, which encodes hamartin, or TSC2, which 
encodes tuberin.

The two TSC proteins form a dimeric complex that negatively regulates m TOR, a kinase that von Hippel–Lindau Disease
In this autosomal dominant disorder, affected persons develop hemangioblastomas within the cerebellar hemi -
spheres, retina, and, less commonly, the brain stem, spinal cord, and nerve roots. Patients also may have cysts involv -
ing the pancreas, liver, and kidneys and have an increased propensity to develop renal cell carcinoma. The disease frequency is 1 in 30,000 to 40,000.

Therapy is directed at the symptomatic neoplasms, including surgical resection of cerebellar tumors and laser ablation of retinal tumors. The affected gene, the tumor suppressor VHL, encodes a protein 
that is part of a ubiquitin-ligase complex that targets the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for deg -
radation. Tumors arising in patients with von Hippel–Lindau disease generally have lost all VHL protein function.

As a result, these tumors express high levels of HIF, which drives the expression of VEGF, various growth factors, and sometimes erythropoietin, leading to a form of paraneo -
plastic polycythemia.

outcomes, depending on where they occur in the brain.

- Distinct types of tumors affect specific brain regions (e.g., 
cerebellum for medulloblastoma, an intraventricular loca-
tion for central neurocytoma) and specific age populations (medulloblastoma and pilocytic astrocytomas in pediatric age groups, and glioblastoma and lymphoma in older patients). - Glial tumors are broadly classified into astrocytomas, oli -
godendrogliomas, and ependymomas.

Increasing tumor malignancy is associated with more cytologic anaplasia, increased cell density, necrosis, and mitotic activity. - Metastatic spr ead of brain tumors to other regions of the 
body is rare, but the brain is not comparably protected against spread of distant tumors. Carcinomas are the dominant type of systemic tumors that metastasize to the nervous system.

Skin diseases are common and diverse, ranging from irri-
tating acne to life-threatening melanoma.

Many are intrin -
sic to the skin, but some are manifestations of diseases involving many tissues, such as systemic lupus erythema -
tosus or genetic syndromes such as neurofibromatosis. In this sense, the skin is a uniquely accessible “window” through which numerous disorders can be viewed and recognized.

Skin is not a mere protective mantle but rather a complex 
organ that actively participates in regulated cellular and molecular events that govern the body’s interactions with the external environment. It is constantly bathed with microbial and nonmicrobial antigens. These are processed by intraepithelial Langerhans cells, which bear their anti -
genic cargo to regional lymph nodes and initiate immune responses.

Squamous cells (keratinocytes) help maintain skin homeostasis by providing a physical barrier to envi -
ronmental insults and by secreting a plethora of cytokines that influence both the squamous and dermal microenvi -
ronments. The dermis contains both CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, some of which home to the skin by virtue of specialized receptors such as cutaneous lymphocyte antigen.

The epidermis contains intraepithelial lymphocytes, including γ/δ T cells, which constitute a com -
ponent of the innate immune system. Local immune responses involving these immune cells and cytokines account for the microscopic patterns and clinical expres -
sions of cutaneous inflammatory and infectious diseases. This chapter focuses on a small subset of common and 
pathogenically illustrative skin diseases.

In considering these diseases, it is important to appreciate that the practice of dermatopathology relies on close interactions with clini -
cians, particularly dermatologists. The clinical history and the gross appearance and distribution of lesions reported by clinicians are often as important as the microscopic find -
ings in arriving at a diagnosis.

Diseases of the skin can be confusing for the student, 
in part because dermatologists and dermatopathologists use a large and unique lexicon to describe skin lesions. Because knowledge of this vocabulary forms the basis of clear understanding and communication, some of the terms and descriptors that are most commonly used are defined below. Terms for Macroscopic Lesions
Excoriation: Traumatic lesion breaking the epidermis and causing a red linear mark (i.e., a deep scratch); often self-inflicted.

Lichenification: Thickened and rough skin character-
ized by prominent skin markings; usually the result 
of repeated rubbing (see under “ Lichen Simplex 
Chronicus”). Macule:
 Flat, circumscribed area, 5 mm or less in diam -
eter, distinguished from surrounding skin by coloration. If greater than 5 mm, referred to as a patch. Papule: Elevated dome- or flat-topped lesion 5 mm or 
less in diameter. If greater than 5 mm in diameter, 
referred to as a nodule.

Plaque: Elevated flat-topped lesion, usually greater than 
5 mm in diameter. Pustule: Discrete, pus-filled raised lesion. Scale: Dry, horny, platelike excrescence; usually the 
result of imperfect cornification. Vesicle:
 Fluid-filled raised area 5 mm or less in diame -
ter. If greater than 5 mm in diameter, referred to as a Skin

MORPHOLOGY
The histologic features of urticaria often are subtle. There is 
usually a sparse superficial perivenular infiltrate of mononu -
clear cells, rare neutrophils, and sometimes eosinophils. Superficial dermal edema creates more widely spaced colla -
gen bundles. Degranulation of mast cells, which normally reside around superficial dermal venules, is difficult to appre -
ciate with routine hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stains but can be highlighted using a Giemsa stain.

PATHOGENESIS
In most cases, urticaria stems from an immediate (type 1) hypersensitivity reaction (Chapter 4), in which antigens trigger mast cell degranulation by binding to immunoglobulin E (Ig E) antibodies displayed on the mast cell surface. The responsible antigens include pollens, foods, drugs, and insect venom. Ig E-independent urticaria may result from exposure to substances that directly incite mast cell degranulation, such as opiates and certain antibiotics.

In the vast majority of cases, no clinical cause is discovered despite extensive search -
ing. Hereditary angioedema is caused by an inherited defi -
ciency of C1 esterase inhibitor, which results in uncontrolled 
bulla. Blister is common term for both vesicles and bullae. Microscopic Terms
Acantholysis: Loss of intercellular adhesion of keratinocytes. Acanthosis: Diffuse epidermal hyperplasia.

Dyskeratosis: Abnormal keratinization occurring pre-
maturely within individual cells or groups of cells below the stratum granulosum. Hyperkeratosis: Hyperplasia of the stratum corneum, 
often associated with a qualitative abnormality of keratin. Lentiginous: Linear melanocyte proliferation along the 
epidermal basal cell layer; can occur as a reactive change or as part of a melanocytic neoplasm. Papillomatosis: Surface elevation caused by hyperplasia 
and enlargement of dermal papillae.

Parakeratosis: Keratinization characterized by retention 
of the nuclei in the stratum corneum. On squamous mucosal membranes, such as buccal mucosa, parakera-tosis is normal. Spongiosis: Intercellular edema of the epidermis. ACUTE INFLAMMATORY 
DERMATOSES
Thousands of inflammatory dermatoses exist, challenging 
the diagnostic acumen of even experienced clinicians.

In general, acute lesions last from days to weeks and are char -
acterized by inflammation (often marked by mononuclear cells rather than neutrophils and defined as acute due to the limited course of their natural history), edema, and sometimes epidermal, vascular, or subcutaneous injury. Some acute lesions may persist, resulting in transition 
to a chronic phase, while others are characteristically self-limited.

Urticaria
Urticaria (“hives”) is a common disorder mediated by 
localized mast cell degranulation, which leads to dermal micro -
vascular hyperpermeability. The resulting erythematous, edematous, and pruritic plaques are termed wheals. Clinical Features
Urticaria typically affects persons between 20 and 40 years of age, but no age is immune. Individual lesions usually develop and fade within hours, but episodes can persist for days or even months.

Persistent lesions sometimes are due to urticarial vasculitis, which is often associated with depo-sition of complement in dermal venules. Lesions range in size and nature from small, pruritic papules to large, edem -
atous, erythematous plaques. Increased vascular permea -
bility leads to localized dermal edema. Lesions can be confined to a particular part of the body or generalized.

In a specific type of urticaria, termed pressure urticaria, lesions 
are found only in areas exposed to pressure (such as the feet or the buttocks). Although not life-threatening, urti -
caria can compromise quality of life by causing severe pru-ritus and social embarrassment. Most cases are treated with antihistamines. Systemic steroids are used in more severe refractory cases.

Acute Eczematous Dermatitis
Eczema is a clinical term that embraces a number of condi-tions with varied underlying etiologies. New lesions take the form of red papules, often with overlying vesicles, which 
ooze and become crusted. With persistence, these lesions 
develop into raised, scaling plaques.

The nature and degree 
of these changes vary among the clinical subtypes, which include the following:
- Allergic contact dermatitis, which stems from topical exposure to an allergen
- Atopic dermatitis, which has traditionally been attributed to allergen exposure, but is now thought to stem from defects in keratinocyte barrier function, many with a genetic basis
- Drug-related eczematous dermatitis, a hypersensitivity 
reaction to a drug
- Photoeczematous dermatitis, in which eczema appears as an abnormal reaction to UV or visible light
- Primary irritant dermatitis, which results from exposure to substances that chemically, physically, or mechani -
cally damage the skin
In most cases, the skin lesions resolve completely when the offending stimulus is removed or exposure is limited, activation of complement ( Chapter 3 ).

The ensuing urticaria 
affects the lips, throat, eyelids, genitals, and distal extremities. When the larynx is affected, the condition can be dangerous, since airway patency may be compromised.

## Page 867

853 Acute Inflammatory Dermatoses 
MORPHOLOGY
In the case of contact dermatitis, the pattern of skin involve -
ment is limited to sites of contact with the triggering agent 
(Fig. 23–1, A), whereas in other forms of eczema, lesions may 
be widely distributed. Spongiosis, or epidermal edema, 
characterizes all forms of acute eczematous dermatitis—hence the synonym spongiotic dermatitis. Edema fluid 
seeps into the epidermis, where it splays apart keratinocytes (Fig. 23–1, B).

Intercellular bridges are stretched and become 
more prominent and are easier to visualize. This change is accompanied by a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infil -
trate, edema of dermal papillae, and mast cell degranulation. Eosinophils may be present and are especially prominent in spongiotic eruptions provoked by drugs, but in general the histologic features are similar regardless of cause, emphasiz -
ing the need for careful clinical correlation. A
B
Figure 23–1 Eczematous dermatitis.

A, The patterned erythema and 
scale stems from a nickel-induced contact dermatitis produced by this 
woman’s necklace. B, Microscopically, there is fluid accumulation (spon -
giosis) between epidermal cells that can progress to small vesicles if intercellular connections are stretched until broken. Clinical Features
Lesions of acute eczematous dermatitis are pruritic (itchy), 
edematous, oozing plaques, often containing vesicles and bullae.

With persistent antigen exposure, lesions may become progressively scaly (hyperkeratotic) as the epider-mis thickens (acanthosis). Some changes are produced or exacerbated by scratching or rubbing of the lesion (see later under “Lichen Simplex Chronicus”). The clinical causes of eczema are sometimes divided into “inside jobs”—reaction to an internal circulating antigen (such as ingested food or drug)—and “outside jobs”—disease resulting from contact with an external antigen (such as poison ivy).

Susceptibility to atopic dermatitis is often inherited; the 
disorder is concordant in 80% of identical twins and 20% of fraternal twins. It usually appears in early childhood and in the majority of cases clears in adults. Children with atopic dermatitis often have asthma and allergic rhinitis, termed the atopic triad. Erythema Multiforme
Erythema multiforme is an uncommon, usually self-limited disorder that appears to be a hypersensitivity response to 
certain infections and drugs.

Antecedent infections include 
herpes simplex and those caused by mycoplasmas and some fungi. The implicated drugs include sulfonamides, MORPHOLOGY
Well-developed lesions have a characteristic “targetoid” appearance (Fig. 23–2, A).

Early lesions show a superficial 
perivascular, lymphocytic infiltrate associated with dermal edema and margination of lymphocytes along the dermoepi -
dermal junction in intimate association with degenerating 
stressing the importance of investigating the underlying 
cause. Only the most common form, contact dermatitis, is 
considered here. Contact dermatitis is triggered by exposure to an envi -
ronmental contact sensitizing agent, such as poison ivy, that chemically reacts with self-proteins.

The self-proteins modified by the agent are processed by epidermal Langer -
hans cells, which migrate to draining lymph nodes and present the antigen to naive T cells. This sensitization event leads to acquisition of immunologic memory; on reexpo -
sure to the antigen, the activated memory CD4 + T lympho-
cytes migrate to the affected skin sites.

There they release cytokines that recruit additional inflammatory cells and also mediate epidermal damage, as in any delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (Chapter 4). penicillin, salicylates, hydantoins, and antimalarials. Patients present with a wide diversity of lesions (hence called 
“multiforme”) including macules, papules, vesicles, and bullae, 
as well as characteristic targetoid lesions consisting of red macules or papules with pale vesicular or eroded centers (Fig. 23–2).

The epithelial damage is believed to result from the action of skin-homing cytotoxic T cells that attack the basal cells of the skin and the mucosae, which may display anti -
gens that cross-react with the inciting drug or microbe.

many months to years, although they may begin with an 
acute stage. The skin surface in some chronic inflammatory dermatoses is roughened as a result of excessive or abnor-mal scale formation and shedding (desquamation). Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory dermatosis, affecting 1% to 2% of people residing in the United States.

Recent epidemiologic studies have shown that psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of heart attack and strokes, a relationship that may be related to a chronic inflammatory state. Psoriasis is also associated in up to 10% of patients with arthritis, which in some cases may be severe. Clinical Features
Erythema multiforme exhibits a broad range of severity. The forms associated with infection (most often herpesvi-rus) are less severe.

Erythema multiforme caused by 
medications can progress to more serious life-threatening eruptions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epi -
dermal necrolysis. These forms can be life-threatening because they can cause sloughing of large portions of the epidermis, resulting in fluid loss and infections akin to those seen in burn-injured patients. These severe forms most often occur as idiopathic reactions to drugs.

CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY 
DERMATOSES
Chronic inflammatory dermatoses are persistent skin con -
ditions that exhibit their most characteristic features over Figure 23–2 Erythema multiforme. A, The target-like lesions consist 
of a pale central blister or zone of epidermal necrosis surrounded by 
macular erythema.

B, Early lesions show a collection of lymphocytes 
along the dermoepidermal junction (interface dermatitis) associated with scattered keratinocytes with dark shrunken nuclei and eosinophilic cyto -
plasm that are undergoing apoptosis. A
B
MORPHOLOGY
The typical lesion is a well-demarcated, pink to salmon–
colored plaque covered by loosely adherent silver-
white scale (Fig. 23–3, A). There is marked epidermal 
thickening (acanthosis), with regular downward elongation 
of the rete ridges ( Fig.

23–3, B). The pattern of this down -
ward growth has been likened to “test tubes in a rack.” Increased epidermal cell turnover and lack of maturation results in loss of the stratum granulosum and exten-
sive parakeratotic scale. Also seen is thinning of the 
epidermal cell layer overlying the tips of dermal papillae (suprapapillary plates), and dilated and tortuous blood vessels within the papillae.

These vessels bleed readily when the scale is removed, giving rise to multiple punctate bleeding points (Auspitz sign). Neutrophils form small aggregates within both the spongiotic superficial epidermis and the parakera -
totic stratum corneum. Similar changes can be seen in super -
ficial fungal infections, which need to be excluded with appropriate special stains.

PATHOGENESIS
Psoriasis is a multifactorial immunologic disease; both genetic (e.g., human leukocyte antigen [HLA] types) and environ -
mental factors contribute to risk. It is not known if the inciting antigens are self or environmental. Sensitized populations of T cells home to the dermis, including CD4 + T
H17 and T H1 
cells and CD8+ T cells, and accumulate in the epidermis.

These cells secrete cytokines and growth factors that induce keratinocyte hyperproliferation, resulting in the characteristic lesions. Psoriatic lesions can be induced in susceptible persons by local trauma (Koebner phenomenon), which may 
induce a local inflammatory response that promotes lesion development. GWAS studies have linked an increased risk of psoriasis to polymorphisms in HLA loci and genes affecting antigen presentation, TNF signaling, and skin barrier function.

Clinical Features
Psoriasis most frequently affects the skin of the elbows, knees, scalp, lumbosacral areas, intergluteal cleft, and glans penis. Nail changes on the fingers and toes occur in 30% of cases. In most cases, psoriasis is limited in distribution, but keratinocytes (Fig. 23–2, B). With time, discrete, confluent 
zones of basal epidermal necrosis appear, with concomitant blister formation.

In the rarer and more severe form of this disease, toxic epidermal necrolysis, the necrosis extends 
through the full thickness of the epidermis.

defined by pattern of involvement and severity.

Treatment is aimed at preventing the release or actions of inflamma -
tory mediators. Depending upon the disease severity, NSAIDS, immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin, and TNF antagonists are used. Newer agents that inhibit T
H1 and T H17 immune responses are also being tested. Lichen Planus
“Pruritic, purple, polygonal, planar papules, and plaques” are the tongue-twisting Ps that describe this disorder of 
skin and squamous mucosa.

The lesions may result from a CD8+ T cell–mediated cytotoxic immune response against antigens in the basal cell layer and the dermoepidermal junction that are produced by unknown mechanisms, perhaps as a consequence of a viral infection or drug exposure. MORPHOLOGY
Cutaneous lesions of lichen planus consist of pruritic, vio-
laceous, flat-topped papules, which may coalesce focally to form plaques (Fig. 23–4, A). These papules are often high-
lighted by white dots or lines called Wickham striae.

Hyperpigmentation may result from melanin loss into the dermis from damaged keratinocytes. Microscopically, lichen planus is a prototypical interface dermatitis, so called 
because the lesions are concentrated at the interface of the squamous epithelium and papillary dermis. There is a dense, continuous infiltrate of lymphocytes along the dermoepider -
mal junction (Fig. 23–4, B). The lymphocytes are intimately 
associated with basal keratinocytes, which often atrophy or become necrotic.

Perhaps as a response to damage, the 
basal cells take on the appearance of the more mature cells of the stratum spinosum (squamatization). This pattern of inflammation causes the dermoepidermal interface to assume an angulated, zigzag contour (“sawtoothing”). Anucleate, necrotic basal cells are seen in the inflamed papillary dermis and are referred to as colloid bodies or Civatte bodies. A

Clinical Features
The lesions often are raised, erythematous, and scaly 
and can be mistaken for keratinocytic neoplasms. Lichen 
simplex chronicus can be superimposed on and mask another (often pruritic) dermatosis. It is therefore impor -
tant to rule out an underlying cause while recognizing that the lesion may be entirely trauma-related.

MORPHOLOGY
Impetigo is characterized by an accumulation of neutrophils beneath the stratum corneum that often produces a subcor -
neal pustule. Nonspecific reactive epidermal alternation and superficial dermal inflammation accompany these findings. Bacterial cocci in the superficial epidermis can be demon -
strated by Gram stain.

SUMMARY
Inflammatory Dermatoses
- Many specific inflammatory dermatoses exist, which can 
be mediated by Ig E antibodies (urticaria), antigen-specific T cells (eczema, erythema multiforme, and psoriasis), or trauma (lichen simplex chronicus). - These disorders can be grouped based on patterns of 
inflammation (e.g., interface dermatitis in lichen planus and erythema multiforme).

- Clinical correlation is essential to diagnose specific skin 
diseases, since many have overlapping, non-specific histo -
logic features. MORPHOLOGY
Lichen simplex chronicus is characterized by acanthosis, 
hyperkeratosis, and hypergranulosis. Also seen are 
elongation of the rete ridges, fibrosis of the papillary dermis, and a dermal chronic inflammatory infiltrate ( Fig. 23–5).

Of 
interest, these lesions are similar in appearance to normal volar (palms and soles) skin, in which skin thickening serves as an adaptation to repetitive mechanical stress. Clinical Features
Lichen planus is an uncommon disorder that usually pre -
sents in middle-aged adults. The cutaneous lesions are multiple and are usually symmetrically distributed, par -
ticularly on the extremities, and often occur about the wrists and elbows and on the glans penis.

In approximately 70% of cases the oral mucosa is also involved, where the lesions manifest as white papules with a reticulate or netlike appearance. The cutaneous lesions of lichen planus usually resolve spontaneously within 1 to 2 years, but the oral lesions may persist and be of sufficient severity to cause trouble with food intake. Lichen Simplex Chronicus
Lichen simplex chronicus manifests as roughening of the skin, which takes on an appearance reminiscent of lichen on a tree.

It is a response to local repetitive trauma such as continual rubbing or scratching. Nodular forms exist that are referred to as prurigo nodularis. The pathogenesis of 
lichen simplex chronicus is not understood, but the trauma probably induces epithelial hyperplasia and eventual dermal scarring. Figure 23–5 Lichen simplex chronicus. Acanthosis with hyperkeratosis 
and hypergranulosis are distinctive. Superficial dermal fibrosis and vascu -
lar ectasia, both common features, also are present.

INFECTIOUS DERMATOSES
Bacterial Infections
Numerous bacterial infections occur in skin. These range from superficial infections known as impetigo, to deeper 
dermal abscesses caused by anaerobes such as Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, associated with puncture wounds. The patho-genesis is similar to that for microbial infections elsewhere (Chapter 8). Only impetigo is discussed here. Clinical Features
Impetigo, one of the most common bacterial infections of the skin, is seen primarily in children.

The causative organism is usually Staphylococcus aureus or, less commonly, Strepto-
coccus pyogenes, and is typically acquired through direct contact with a source. Impetigo often begins as a single small macule, usually on the extremities or the face near the nose or the mouth (Fig. 23–6), which rapidly evolves into a larger lesion with a honey-colored crust of dried serum. Persons colonized by S. aureus or S. pyogenes (usually 
nasal or anal) are more likely to be affected.

Microbiologic culture with assessment of sensitivity to various antibiotics can be useful clinically. A less common bullous form of childhood impetigo may mimic an autoimmune blistering disorder. Although these changes bear some similarities to those in erythema multiforme (discussed earlier), lichen planus shows well-developed changes of chronicity, including epidermal hyperplasia, hypergranulosis, and hyperkeratosis.

857 Blistering (Bullous) Disorders
Fungal Infections
Fungal infections are varied and range from superficial 
infections with Tinea or Candida spp. to life-threatening 
infections of immunosuppressed persons with Aspergillus 
spp. Fungal infections can be superficial (stratum corneum, hair, and nails), deep (dermis or subcutis), or systemic, the last type arising through hematogenous spread, often in an immunocompromised patient. Figure 23–6 Impetigo.

This child’s arm is involved by a superficial bacte -
rial infection producing the characteristic erythematous scablike lesions 
crusted with dried serum. (Courtesy of Dr. Angela Wyatt, Bellaire, Texas.)
MORPHOLOGY
The histologic appearance varies depending on the organism, 
host response, and degree of superinfection. Superficial infections are often associated with a neutrophilic infiltrate in the epidermis.

Some show a mild eczematous dermatitis with associated intraepidermal neutrophils, while other infections (e.g., Candida) can induce psoriasiform hyperplasia. Deep 
fungal infections produce greater tissue damage and often elicit a granulomatous response, probably induced by the more vigorous host immune response. Aspergillus can be 
angioinvasive. Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) and Gomori meth -
enamine silver stains can be helpful in identifying the fungal organisms.

Clinical Features
Superficial infections usually produce erythematous macules with superficial scale that can be pruritic, while deeper infections such as those seen with Aspergillus spp. in immunocompromised persons are erythematous and often nodular and sometimes show evidence of local hem -
orrhage. Superficial Candida infections often induce lesions 
that mimic psoriasis, so it is essential to exclude fungal infections when a new diagnosis of psoriasis is being considered.

Verrucae (Warts)
Verrucae are common lesions of children and adolescents, although they may be encountered in any age group. They are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Transmission usually involves direct contact with an infected individual or autoinoculation. Verrucae generally are self-limited, most often regressing spontaneously within 6 months to 2 years. PATHOGENESIS
As mentioned earlier, verrucae are caused by HPV.

Some members of the HPV family are associated with preneoplas -
tic and invasive cancers of the anogenital region (Chapters 5 and 17). In contrast with HPV-associated carcinomas, most warts are caused by low-risk HPV subtypes that lack trans -
forming potential. Like high-risk viruses, these low-risk viruses express viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins that lead to dysregu -
lated epidermal cell growth and increased survival.

Why low-risk viruses cause warts instead of cancer is unclear; subtle functional differences due to structural variation in E6 and E7 proteins that affect interactions with host proteins as well as differences in the abilities of different viral strains to evade the immune response have been proposed. The immune response normally limits the growth of these tumors, and immunodeficiency often is associated with increased numbers and larger sized verrucae.

MORPHOLOGY
Different kinds of warts are identified on the basis of their gross appearance and location and generally are caused by distinct HPV subtypes. Verruca vulgaris (Fig. 23–7, A), the 
most common type of wart, can occur anywhere but is found most frequently on the hands, particularly on the dorsal 
surfaces and periungual areas, where it appears as a gray-white to tan, flat to convex, 0.1- to 1-cm papule with a rough, pebble-like surface.

Verruca plana, or flat wart, is 
common on the face or dorsal surfaces of the hands. These warts are flat, smooth, tan macules. Verruca plantaris and 
verruca palmaris occur on the soles and palms, respec-
tively. These rough, scaly lesions may reach 1 to 2 cm in 
diameter and then coalesce to form a surface that can be confused with ordinary calluses. Condyloma acumina -
tum (venereal wart) occurs on the penis, female genitalia, 
urethra, and perianal areas ( Chapters 17 and 18 ).

Histologic 
features common to verrucae include epidermal hyper -
plasia, which is often undulant in character (so-called ver -
rucous or papillomatous epidermal hyperplasia) ( Fig. 23–7, 
B, top panel), and cytoplasmic vacuolization (koilocytosis), 
which preferentially involves the more superficial epidermal layers, producing halos of pallor surrounding infected nuclei.

Infected cells also may demonstrate prominent keratohyalin granules and jagged eosinophilic intracytoplasmic protein aggregates as a result of impaired maturation (Fig. 23–7, B, 
bottom panel). BLISTERING (BULLOUS) DISORDERS
Although vesicles and bullae (blisters) occur as a secondary phenomenon in several unrelated conditions (e.g., herpes -
virus infection, spongiotic dermatitis), there is a group of

Pemphigus (Vulgaris and Foliaceus)
Pemphigus is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder result -

ated with oropharyngeal involvement at some point in their course. Most patients require immunosuppressive therapy, sometimes for the remainder of their lives.

Medi -
cations can cause pemphigus, and when they do, patients most often present with pemphigus foliaceus rather than pemphigus vulgaris. There is also an unusual endemic form of pemphigus foliaceus in South America ( fogo 
selvagem) that is putatively associated with the bite of a black fly. Bullous Pemphigoid
Bullous pemphigoid is another distinctive acquired blister -
ing disorder with an autoimmune basis.

MORPHOLOGY
Pemphigus vulgaris, by far the most common type, involves both mucosa and skin, especially on the scalp, face, axillae, groin, trunk, and points of pressure. The lesions are superficial flaccid vesicles and bullae that rupture easily, leaving deep and often extensive erosions covered with a serum crust (Fig. 23–10, A). Pemphigus foliaceus, a rare, 
more benign form of pemphigus, results in bullae confined to skin, with only infrequent involvement of mucous mem -
branes.

The blisters in this disorder are superficial, such that more limited zones of erythema and crusting of ruptured blisters are seen (Fig. 23–11, A). The common histologic denominator in all forms of pem -
phigus is acantholysis, lysis of the intercellular adhesive 
junctions between neighboring squamous epithelial cells that results in the rounding up of detached cells.

In pemphigus vulgaris, acantholysis selectively involves the layer of cells immediately above the basal cell layer, giving rise to a supra-
basal acantholytic blister (Fig. 23–10, B). In pemphigus 
foliaceus, acantholysis selectively involves the superficial 
pathogenic antibodies are Ig G autoantibodies that bind to intercellular desmosomal proteins (desmoglein types 1 and 3) of skin and mucous membranes.

The antibodies disrupt the intercellular adhesive function of the desmosomes and may activate intercellular proteases as well. The distribution of these proteins within the epidermis determines the loca -
tion of the lesions. By direct immunofluorescence study, lesional sites show a characteristic fishnet-like pattern of intercellular Ig G deposits ( Fig. 23–9). As in other autoimmune 
diseases, pemphigus shows linkage with particular HLA alleles.

Grossly, the lesions of bullous pemphigoid appear as tense

epidermal nonacantholytic blisters.

Blistering in bullous pemphigoid is triggered by the linear 
deposition of Ig G antibodies and complement in the epider -
mal basement membrane ( Fig. 23–12, A).

Reactivity also 
occurs in the basement membrane attachment plaques (hemidesmosomes), where most of the bullous pemphigoid antigen (type XVII collagen) is located. This protein normally is involved in dermoepidermal adhesion. Ig G autoantibodies to hemidesmosome components fix complement and cause tissue injury by recruiting neutrophils and eosinophils.

861 Blistering (Bullous) Disorders
Clinical Features
The bullae do not rupture as readily as in pemphigus and, 
if uncomplicated by infection, heal without scarring. The disease tends to follow a remitting and relapsing course and responds to topical or systemic immunosuppressive agents. Gestational pemphigoid (also known as herpes ges-
tationis, a misnomer) is a clinically distinct subtype that appears suddenly during the second or third trimester of pregnancy.

It is also caused by autoantibodies against BPAG. It typically resolves after childbirth, but may recur with future pregnancies. Dermatitis Herpetiformis
Dermatitis herpetiformis is another type of autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by extremely pruritic 
urticaria and grouped vesicles. The disease affects predomi -
nantly males, often in the third and fourth decades of life.

In up to 80% of cases, it occurs in association with celiac disease; conversely, only a small minority of patients 
with celiac disease develop dermatitis herpetiformis. Like celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis responds to a glu -
ten-free diet. PATHOGENESIS
The strong association of dermatitis herpetiformis with celiac disease provides a clue to its pathogenesis.

Genetically pre -
disposed persons develop Ig A antibodies to dietary gluten (derived from the wheat protein gliadin) as well as Ig A auto-antibodies that cross-react with endomysium and tissue transglutaminases, including epidermal transglutaminase expressed by keratinocytes. By direct immunofluorescence, the skin shows discontinuous, granular deposits of Ig A 
selectively localized in the tips of dermal papillae ( Fig. 23–13, 
A).

The resultant injury and inflammation produce a subepi -
dermal blister. MORPHOLOGY
The lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis are bilateral, sym -
metric, and grouped and preferentially involve the extensor surfaces, elbows, knees, upper back, and buttocks ( Fig. 23–
13, B). Initially, neutrophils accumulate selectively at the tips 
of dermal papillae, forming small microabscesses (Fig. 23–13, C).

The basal cells overlying these microabscesses 
show vacuolization and focal dermoepidermal separation that ultimately coalesce to form a true subepidermal 
blister. B

MORPHOLOGY
Seborrheic keratoses are round, exophytic, coin-like 
plaques varying in diameter from millimeters to centimeters 
that have a “stuck-on” appearance (Fig. 23–14, inset). They are tan to dark brown and have a velvety- to granular-appearing surface. Occasionally, their dark color is suggestive of melanoma, leading to surgical removal. SUMMARY
Blistering Disorders
- Blistering disorders are classified b y the level of epidermal 
separation.

- These disorders are often caused by autoantibodies spe -
cific for epithelial or basement membrane proteins that lead to unmooring of keratinocytes (acantholysis). - Pemphigus is associated with Ig G autoantibodies to 
various intercellular desmogleins, resulting in bullae that are either subcorneal (pemphigus foliaceus) or suprabasa -
lar (pemphigus vulgaris). - Bullous pemphigoid is associated with Ig G autoantibodies 
to basement membrane proteins and produces a subepi -
dermal blister.

- Dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with Ig A autoanti -
bodies to fibrils that bind the epidermal basement 
membrane to the dermis, and is also characterized by subepidermal blisters. MORPHOLOGY
Actinic keratoses usually are less than 1 cm in diameter, tan-
brown or red in color, and rough (sandpaper-like) to the touch (Fig. 23–15, A). Microscopically, lower portions of the 
epidermis show cytologic atypia, often associated with 
hyperplasia of basal cells ( Fig.

23–15, B) or with atrophy and 
diffuse thinning of the epidermal surface. The dermis contains thickened, blue-gray elastic fibers (solar elastosis), the result of chronic sun damage. The stratum corneum is thickened with retained nuclei (parakeratosis). In some lesions full thick -
ness epidermal atypia is seen; such lesions are considered forms of squamous cell carcinoma in situ (Fig. 23–15, C).

BENIGN AND PREMALIGNANT 
TUMORS
Benign and Premalignant Epithelial Lesions
Benign epithelial neoplasms are common and probably 
arise from stem cells residing in the epidermis and hair follicles. These tumors grow to a limited size and generally do not undergo malignant transformation. Seborrheic Keratosis
These common pigmented epidermal tumors occur most frequently in middle-aged or older persons.

They arise spontaneously and are particularly numerous on the trunk, although the extremities, head, and neck also may be sites of involvement. A significant fraction of these tumors harbor activating 
mutations in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 3, which 
possesses a tyrosine kinase activity that stimulates Ras and the PI3K/AKT pathways. Except for cosmetic concerns, they are usually of little clinical importance.

However, 
in rare patients hundreds of lesions may appear sud -
denly as a paraneoplastic syndrome (sign of Lesser-Trelat). Patients with this presentation may harbor internal malig -
nancies, most commonly gastrointestinal tract carcinomas, which produce growth factors that stimulate epidermal proliferation. Figure 23–14 Seborrheic keratosis. This roughened, brown, waxy 
lesion almost appears to be “stuck on” the skin ( inset).

Microscopic 
examination shows the lesion to consist of an orderly proliferation of 
uniform, basaloid keratinocytes that tend to form keratin microcysts (horn cysts). Microscopically, seborrheic keratoses are composed of 
monotonous sheets of small cells that resemble the basal 
cells of the normal epidermis (Fig. 23–14). Variable melanin pigmentation is present within these basaloid cells, accounting for the brown coloration seen grossly.

Hyperkeratosis occurs at the surface, and the presence of small keratin-filled cysts (horn cysts) and downgrowth of keratin into the main tumor mass (pseudo–horn cysts) are characteristic features. Actinic Keratosis
Overt malignancy of the epidermis (squamous cell carci -
noma) may be preceded by a series of progressive dysplas -
tic changes.

Because such lesions usually are the result 
of chronic exposure to sunlight and are associated with hyperkeratosis, they are called actinic (sun-related) kerato -
ses. Whether all actinic keratoses evolve to carcinoma with time is conjectural; many lesions regress or remain stable. Enough become malignant, however, to warrant local eradication. A high fraction of these lesions are associated with TP53 mutations caused by UV light–induced DNA 
damage.

Clinical Features
Actinic keratoses are very common in fair-skinned people 
and increase in incidence with age and increasing sun exposure. As would be expected, there is a predilection for sun-exposed areas (face, arms, dorsum of the hands). The lesions can be treated with local cryotherapy (superficial freezing) or topical agents.

SUMMARY
Benign and Premalignant Epithelial Lesions
- Seborrheic keratosis: Round, flat plaques made up of prolif -
erating monotonous epidermal basal cells, which some -
times contain melanin. Hyperkeratosis and keratin-filled cysts are characteristic. - Actinic keratosis: Present on sun-exposed skin, these lesions show cytologic atypia in lower parts of epidermis and infrequently progress to carcinoma in situ.

Malignant Epidermal T umors
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma is a common tumor arising on sun-
exposed sites in older people. These tumors have a higher 
incidence in men than in women. In addition to sunlight, predisposing factors include industrial carcinogens (tars and oils), chronic ulcers, old burn scars, ingestion of arseni-cals, and ionizing radiation. As with squamous cell carci -
nomas at other sites, those in the skin may be preceded by in situ lesions.

PATHOGENESIS
The most common exogenous cause of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is UV light exposure, which causes DNA damage (Chapter 5). TP53 mutations caused by UV light–
induced DNA damage are common, as are activating 
mutations in HRAS and loss-of-function mutations in Notch 
receptors, which transmit signals that regulate the orderly differentiation of normal squamous epithelia.

In addition to inducing mutations, UV light (UVB in particular) may have a transient immunosuppressive effect on skin by impairing antigen presentation by Langerhans cells. This effect may contribute to tumorigenesis by weakening immunosurveil -
lance. Patients who are immunosuppressed as a result of chemotherapy or organ transplantation, or who have 
xeroderma pigmentosum, are at increased risk.

Tumors in immunosuppressed persons, particularly organ transplant recipients, are likely to be associated with HPV infection. TP53 mutations caused by UV light–induced DNA damage are common, as are activating mutations in HRAS. As with 
squamous cell carcinomas at other sites, those in the skin may be preceded by in situ lesions. MORPHOLOGY
Squamous cell carcinomas in situ appear as sharply defined, red, scaling plaques; many arise from prior actinic keratoses.

More advanced, invasive lesions are nodular, show variable scale, and may ulcerate ( Fig. 23–16, A). Microscopically, squa-
mous cell carcinoma in situ is characterized by highly atypical cells at all levels of the epidermis, with nuclear crowding 
and disorganization. Invasive tumors, defined by penetration of the basement membrane (Fig.

23–16, B), show variable 
degrees of differentiation, ranging from tumors with cells arranged in orderly lobules that exhibit extensive keratiniza -
tion to neoplasms consisting of highly anaplastic cells with 
foci of necrosis and only abortive, single-cell keratinization (dyskeratosis). Clinical Features
Invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the skin often are discovered while small and resectable. Less than 5% have metastasized to regional nodes at diagnosis.

The likelihood of metastasis is related to the thickness of the lesion and degree of invasion into the subcutis. Tumors arising in the context of actinic keratoses may be locally aggressive but

## Page 878

Clinical Features
It is estimated that in excess of 1 million basal cell carcino -
mas are treated in the United States annually. By far the 
most important risk factor is sun exposure; basal cell car -
cinoma is more common in warm southern regions of the United States, and its incidence is 40-fold higher in sunny climates near the equator, such as Australia, than it is in Northern European locales.

Individual tumors usually are cured by local excision, but approximately 40% of patients will develop another basal cell carcinoma within 5 years. Advanced lesions may ulcerate, and extensive local inva-sion of bone or facial sinuses may occur if the lesions are neglected for many years. SUMMARY
Malignant Epidermal T umors
- The incidence of both basal cell and squamous cell carci -
noma is strongly correlated with increasing lifetime sun exposure.

- Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma can progress from 
actinic keratoses but also arises from chemical exposure, at thermal burn sites, or in association with HPV infection in the setting of immunosuppression. - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma has potential for 
metastasis but is much less aggressive than squamous cell carcinoma at mucosal sites. - Basal cell carcinoma, the most common malignancy world -
wide, is a locally aggressive tumor associated with muta -
tions in the Hedgehog pathway.

Metastasis is very rare. MORPHOLOGY
Grossly, basal cell carcinomas manifest as pearly papules, 
often with prominent, dilated subepidermal blood vessels (telangiectasia) (Fig. 23–17, A). Some tumors 
contain melanin pigment and thus appear similar to melano -
cytic nevi or melanomas. Microscopically, the tumor cells resemble the normal epidermal basal cell layer from which they are derived.

Because they may arise from either the epidermis or the follicular epithelium, they are not encoun -
tered on mucosal surfaces. Two common patterns are seen: multifocal growths originating from the epidermis (super-ficial pattern), or nodular lesions growing downward into 
the dermis as cords and islands of variably basophilic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, embedded in a fibrotic or muci -
nous stromal matrix ( Fig. 23–17, B).

Peripheral tumor cell 
nuclei align in the outermost layer (a pattern termed palisad -
ing), which often separates from the stroma, creating a char -
acteristic cleft (Fig. 23–17, C). PATHOGENESIS
Basal cell carcinoma is associated with dysregulation of the Hedgehog pathway. Inherited defects in the PTCH 
gene, a tumor suppressor that regulates Hedgehog pathway signaling, cause familial basal cell carcinomas in Gorlin syn -
drome.

The Hedgehog pathway is an important regulator of 
generally metastasize only after long periods of time, while 
those arising in burn scars, ulcers, and non–sun-exposed skin behave less predictably. Mucosal squamous cell carci -
nomas (oral, pulmonary, esophageal, etc.) generally are much more aggressive. Basal Cell Carcinoma
Basal cell carcinoma is a common slow-growing cancer that 
rarely metastasizes.

It tends to occur at sites subject to chronic sun exposure and in lightly pigmented individuals. A

embryonic development, and subtle developmental anoma -
lies are also often noted in affected persons. Some compo -
nent of the hedgehog pathway is mutated in the great majority 
of sporadic basal cell carcinomas as well. Mutations in TP53 
are also common in both familial and sporadic tumors.

865 Benign and Premalignant Tumors
Clinical Features
There are numerous types of melanocytic nevi, with varied 
appearances. Although these lesions usually are of only cosmetic concern, they can become irritating or mimic melanoma, requiring their surgical removal. Compound and intradermal nevi often are more elevated than junc -
tional nevi. Dysplastic Nevus
Dysplastic nevi may be sporadic or familial.

The latter are 
important clinically because they are con sidered potential 
precursors of melanoma. As with conventional melano -
cytic nevi, activating NRAS or BRAF mutations are com-
monly found in dysplastic nevi and are believed to have a pathogenic role. Melanocytic Proliferations
Melanocytic Nevi
Strictly speaking, the term nevus denotes any congenital 
lesion of the skin. Melanocytic nevus, however, refers to any 
benign congenital or acquired neoplasm of melanocytes.

MORPHOLOGY
Common melanocytic nevi are tan-to-brown, uniformly pig -
mented, small papules (5 mm or less across) with well-
defined, rounded borders ( Fig. 23–19, A). Early lesions are 
composed of round-to-oval cells that grow in “nests” along the dermoepidermal junction. Nuclei are uniform and round, and contain inconspicuous nucleoli with little or no mitotic activity. Such early-stage lesions are called junctional nevi.

Eventually, most junctional nevi grow into the underlying dermis as nests or cords of cells (compound nevi), and in 
older lesions the epidermal nests may be lost entirely, creat-ing an intradermal nevi (Fig. 23–19, B). PATHOGENESIS
Melanocytic nevi are benign neoplasms derived from mela-nocytes, highly dendritic, pigment-producing cells that are normally interspersed among basal keratinocytes.

Progres-sive growth and migration of nevus cells from the dermoepi -
dermal junction into the underlying dermis is accompanied by changes that are taken as evidence of cellular senescence 
(Fig. 23–18). Superficial nevus cells are larger and tend to produce melanin pigment and grow in nests; deeper nevus cells are smaller, produce little or no pigment, and grow in cords or single cells. The deepest nevus cells have fusiform contours and grow in fascicles.

This sequence of morphologic changes is of diagnostic importance, since they are absent from melanomas. The majority of benign nevi have an activat-ing mutation in BRAF, which encodes a serine/threonine 
kinase downstream from RAS in the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, or less commonly in NRAS itself. Experimental evidence suggests that unbridled BRAF/RAS signaling initially induces melanocytic proliferation followed by senescence.

How these opposing effects are coordinated is unclear, but it is believed that the “brake” on proliferation provided by induced senescence explains why very few nevi transform into malignant melanomas. A B C

C, The tumor cells have scant cytoplasm and small hyperchromatic nuclei that palisade on the

B, This nevus shows rounded mela-
nocytes that lose their pigmentation and become smaller and more separated as they extend into the dermis—all signs of cellular senescence that 
speak to the benign nature of the proliferation. MORPHOLOGY
Dysplastic nevi are larger than most acquired nevi (often 
more than 5 mm across) and may number in the hun-
dreds (Fig. 23–20, A). They are flat macules to slightly raised 
plaques, with a “pebbly” surface.

They usually have variable pigmentation (variegation) and irregular borders ( Fig. 23–20, 
A, inset). Microscopically, dysplastic nevi are mostly compound nevi 
that exhibit both architectural and cytologic evidence of abnormal growth. Nevus cell nests within the epidermis may be enlarged and exhibit abnormal fusion or coalescence with adjacent nests (bridging).

As part of this process, single nevus cells begin to replace the normal basal cell layer along the dermoepidermal junction, producing so-called lentiginous hyperplasia (Fig. 23–20, B). Cytologic atypia consisting of 
irregular, often angulated, nuclear contours and hyperchro -
masia is frequently observed (Fig. 23–20, B and C). Associ-
ated alterations also occur in the superficial dermis.

These 
consist of a sparse lymphocytic infiltrate, release of melanin pigment that is phagocytosed by dermal macrophages (melanin incontinence), and linear fibrosis surrounding epi -
dermal nests of melanocytes. These dermal changes are ele -
ments of the host response to these lesions. Clinical Features
Unlike ordinary nevi, dysplastic nevi have a tendency to occur 
on body surfaces not exposed to the sun as well as on sun-
exposed sites.

Familial dysplastic nevus syndrome is strongly 
associated with melanoma, as the lifetime risk for the develop -
ment of melanoma in affected persons is close to 100% . In 
sporadic cases, only individuals with 10 or more dysplastic nevi appear to be at an increased risk for melanoma. Trans -
formation of dysplastic nevus to melanoma has been docu -
mented, both clinically and histologically. However, such cases are the exception, as most melanomas arise de novo and not from a preexisting nevus.

Thus, the likelihood that

## Page 881

867 Benign and Premalignant Tumors
any particular nevus, dysplastic or otherwise, will develop 
into melanoma is exceedingly low, and these lesions are 
best viewed as markers of melanoma risk. Melanoma
Melanoma is less common but much more deadly than basal or squamous cell carcinoma. Today, as a result of increased public awareness of the earliest signs of skin melanomas, most melanomas are cured surgically.

None-theless, the incidence of these lesions has increased dra -
matically over the past several decades, at least in part as a result of increasing sun exposure and/or higher detection rates resulting from vigorous surveillance. A B CC

B, Compound dysplastic nevi feature a central dermal

mented and raised central zone (see A, inset), and the latter, to the less pigmented flat peripheral rim. C, Other important features are cytologic atypia 
(irregular, dark-staining nuclei) and characteristic parallel bands of fibrosis—part of the host response to these lesions.

PATHOGENESIS
As with other cutaneous malignancies, sunlight plays an important role in the development of melanoma. The inci-dence is highest in sun-exposed skin and in geographic locales such as Australia where sun exposure is high and much of the population is fair-skinned. Intense intermittent exposure at an early age is particularly harmful.

Recent “deep sequenc -
ing” studies have confirmed that tumor genomes contain thousands of acquired mutations, most bearing a signature consistent with UV-induced DNA damage. Sunlight, however, is not the only predisposing factor; hereditary predisposition also plays a role, as already discussed under familial dysplastic nevus syndrome. As with other cancers, it is believed that melanoma may 
arise in a stepwise fashion from precursor lesions (Fig. 23–21).

Key phases of tumor development are marked by radial and vertical growth. Radial growth describes the 
initial tendency of a melanoma to grow horizontally within the epidermis (in situ), often for a prolonged period ( Fig. 23–21, D). During this stage, melanoma cells do not have the 
capacity to metastasize, and do not induce angiogenesis.

With time, a vertical growth phase supervenes, in which 
the tumor grows downward into the deeper dermal layers as an expansile mass lacking cellular maturation ( Fig. 23–21, E). This event often is heralded by the development of a nodule in a previously flat lesion (Fig. 23-22, A) and correlates with 
the emergence of a clone of cells with metastatic potential. Most melanomas occur sporadically, but a few are heredi-
tary (with reported rates ranging from less than 5% to 10%).

Molecular genetic analysis of familial and sporadic cases has provided important insights into the pathogenesis of mela -
noma. As with other tumors, malignant transformation of melanocytes is a multistep process that involves activating mutations in proto-oncogenes and loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes. Germline mutations in the CDKN2A gene (located on 9p21) are found in as many as 40% of the rare individuals who suffer from familial melanoma.

This gene encodes the tumor suppressor p16, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that regulates the G
1-S transition 
of the cell cycle in a retinoblastoma protein–dependent fashion (Chapter 5). The CDNK2A gene also is silenced in 
some sporadic tumors by methylation. Somatic activating mutations in the proto-oncogenes BRAF or NRAS are observed 
in a high proportion of melanomas.

These mutations, which promote cellular proliferation and survival by activating the extracellular signal–regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway, generally are mutually exclusive, since BRAF functions down -
stream of RAS. Also frequently seen is loss of function of the 
tumor suppressor PTEN, an important negative regulator of 
PI3K-AKT pathway, which also promotes growth and sur -
vival.

Some melanomas, particular those arising in acral and mucosal sites, have activating mutations in the c-K IT receptor 
tyrosine kinase. Agents that selectively inhibit mutant BRAF and c-KIT have produced dramatic responses in patients with metastatic tumors with BRAF and c-KIT mutations, respec-tively, an encouraging example of molecularly targeted therapy in an otherwise hopeless disease.

MORPHOLOGY
Unlike benign nevi, melanomas exhibit striking variations 
in pigmentation, including shades of black, brown, red, 
dark blue, and gray (Fig. 23–22, A). The borders are irreg-
ular and often “notched.”
Microscopically, malignant cells grow as poorly formed 
nests or as individual cells at all levels of the epidermis (page-toid spread) and in expansile dermal nodules; these consti -
tute the radial and vertical growth phases, respectively ( Fig. 23–22, B and C).

Of note, superficial spreading melanomas 
are often associated with a brisk lymphocytic infiltrate ( Fig. 23–22, B), a feature that may reflect a host response to 
tumor-specific antigens. The nature and extent of the 
vertical growth phase determine the biologic behav-ior of melanomas. By recording and using these and other variables in aggregate, accurate prognostication is possible. Individual melanoma cells usually are considerably larger 
than nevus cells.

They have large nuclei with irregular con -
tours, chromatin that is characteristically clumped at the periphery of the nuclear membrane, and prominent “cherry red” eosinophilic nucleoli (Fig. 23–22, D). Immunohistochem-
ical stains can be helpful in identifying metastatic deposits (Fig. 23–22, D, inset). A B C D E

Clinical Features
Although most of these lesions arise in the skin, they also may involve the oral and anogenital mucosal surfaces, the 
esophagus, the meninges, and the eye. The following com -
ments apply to cutaneous melanomas. Melanoma of the skin usually is asymptomatic, although 
pruritus may be an early manifestation. The most important clinical sign is a change in the color or size of a pigmented lesion. The main clinical warning signs are
1. Rapid enlargement of a preexisting nevus
2.

Itching or pain in a lesion
3. Development of a new pigmented lesion during adult 
life
4. Irregularity of the borders of a pigmented lesion
5. Variegation of color within a pigmented lesion
These principles are expressed in the so-called ABCs of melanoma: asymmetry, border, color, diameter, and evolu-
tion (change of an existing nevus). It is vitally important 
to recognize melanomas and intervene as rapidly as pos -
sible.

The vast majority of superficial lesions are curable surgically, while metastatic melanoma has a very poor prognosis. The probability of metastasis is predicted by measuring 
the depth of invasion in millimeters of the vertical growth phase nodule from the top of the granular cell layer of the overlying epidermis (Breslow thickness). Metastasis risk also is increased in tumors with a high mitotic rate and in those that fail to induce a local immune response.

When metastases occur, they involve not only regional lymph nodes but also liver, lungs, brain, and virtually any other site that can be seeded hematogenously. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (of the first draining node[s] of a primary melanoma) at the time of surgery provides additional information on biologic aggressiveness.

In some cases, metastases may appear for the first time 
many years after complete surgical excision of the primary tumor, suggesting a long phase of dormancy, during which time the tumor may be held in check by the host immune response. Recognition of the likely role of the host immune response has led to therapeutic trials of immunomodula -
tors. Some impressive responses in patients with advanced

869 Benign and Premalignant Tumors
SUMMARY
Melanocytic Lesions, Benign and Malignant
- Most melanocytic nevi have activating mutations in BRAF or 
less often NRAS, but the vast majority never undergo 
malignant transformation. - Most sporadic dysplastic nevi are best regarded as markers 
of melanoma risk rather than premalignant lesions. They 
are characterized by architectural and cytologic atypia.

- Melanoma is a highly aggressive malignancy; tumors only a few millimeters in thickness can give rise to deadly metastases. A B
C D
Figure 23–22 Melanoma. A, On clinical evaluation, lesions tend to be larger than nevi, with irregular contours and pigmentation. Macular areas 
indicate early superficial (radial) growth, while elevated areas often indicate dermal invasion (vertical growth). B, Radial growth phase, with spread of 
nested and single-cell melanoma cells within the epidermis.

C, Vertical growth phase, with nodular aggregates of infiltrating tumor cells within the 
dermis (epidermis is on the right). D, Melanoma cells have hyperchromatic nuclei of irregular size and shape with prominent nucleoli. Mitoses, including 
atypical forms such as seen in the center of this field, often are encountered. The inset shows a sentinel lymph node containing a tiny cluster of meta -
static melanoma cells (arrow), detected by staining for the melanocytic marker HMB-45.

melanoma have been seen, especially to antibodies that block endogenous inhibitors of immune responses such as CTLA-4 and PD-1, and thus “release the brakes” on host antitumor immunity. BIBLIOGRAPHY
